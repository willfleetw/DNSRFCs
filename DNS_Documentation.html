<p>This document describes the Domain Name System (DNS), including the design, server roles, algorithms, data, use cases, and on the wire message protocol that make up the DNS. The DNS design and usage is defined in a large number of different RFCs starting back in 1983, many of which have been corrected, clarified, extended, updated, or made completely obsolete by more modern RFCs. This makes understanding the current DNS specifications in its entirety quite difficult and realistically impossible for most people.</p>
<p>In order to combat this issue, and thus make any future DNS development both easier and more accurate, this document attempts to compile all the relevent DNS RFCs into one single, up to date, clear, all encompassing document. Note that in the future, depending on the size of this document, it may be split up into multiple documents for readability.</p>
<p>For a <em>fairly</em> complete list of DNS related RFCs, see <a href="https://www.bind9.net/rfc" class="uri">https://www.bind9.net/rfc</a>.</p>

<h1 data-number="2" id="dns-introduction"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> DNS Introduction</h1>
<p>The DNS should be thought of as a distributed, hierarchical, somewhat limited database potentially capable of storing almost any type of data. Every piece of data in the DNS is mapped to a domain name, a class, and a type.</p>
<p>The DNS has three major components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The DOMAIN NAME SPACE and RESOURCE RECORDS, which are specifications for a tree structured name space and data associated with the names. Conceptually, each node and leaf of the domain name space tree names a set of information, and query operations are attempts to extract specific types of information from a particular set. A query names the domain name of interest and describes the type of resource information that is desired. For example, the Internet uses some of its domain names to identify hosts; queries for address resources return Internet host addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>NAME SERVERS are server programs which hold information about the domain tree’s structure and set information. A name server may cache structure or set information about any part of the domain tree, but in general a particular name server has complete information about a subset of the domain space, and pointers to other name servers that can be used to lead to information from any part of the domain tree. Name servers know the parts of the domain tree for which they have complete information; a name server is said to be an AUTHORITY for these parts of the name space. Authoritative information is organized into units called ZONEs, and these zones can be automatically distributed to the name servers which provide redundant service for the data in a zone.</p></li>
<li><p>RESOLVERS are programs that extract information from name servers in response to client requests. Resolvers must be able to access at least one name server and use that name server’s information to answer a query directly, or pursue the query using referrals to other name servers. A resolver will typically be a system routine that is directly accessible to user programs; hence no protocol is necessary between the resolver and the user program.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The domain name space is a tree structure. Each node and leaf on the tree corresponds to a resource set (which may be empty). The domain system makes no distinctions between the uses of the interior nodes and leaves, and the term “node” refers to both.</p>
<p>Each node has a label, which is zero to 63 octets in length. Sibling nodes may not have the same label, although the same label can be used for nodes which are not siblings. One label is reserved, and that is the null (i.e., zero length) label used for the root.</p>
<p>The domain name of a node is the list of the labels on the path from the node to the root of the tree. By convention, the labels that compose a domain name are printed or read left to right, from the most specific (lowest, farthest from the root) to the least specific (highest, closest to the root), which each label being seperated by a “.”. The domain name of a node ends with the root label, and is often written as “.”. For example, the domain name of the “XX” node on the tree would be written as “XX.LCS.MIT.EDU.”.</p>
<p>By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in a case-insensitive manner. When receiving a domain name or label, you should preserve its case.</p>
<p>When a user needs to type a domain name, the length of each label is omitted and the labels are separated by dots (“.”). Since a complete domain name ends with the root label, this leads to a printed form which ends in a dot. We use this property to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a character string which represents a complete domain name (often called “absolute”). For example, “poneria.ISI.EDU.”</p></li>
<li><p>a character string that represents the starting labels of a domain name which is incomplete, and should be completed by local software using knowledge of the local domain (often called “relative”). For example, “poneria” used in the ISI.EDU domain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, programs that manipulate domain names should represent them as sequences of labels, where each label is a length octet followed by an octet string. Because all domain names end at the root, which has a null string for a label, these internal representations can use a length byte of zero to terminate a domain name.</p>
<p>To simplify implementations, the total number of octets that represent a domain name (i.e., the sum of all label octets and label lengths) is limited to 255.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="name-syntax"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Name Syntax</h2>
<p>The DNS itself places only one restriction on the particular labels that can be used to identify resource records. That one restriction relates to the length of the label and the full name. The length of any one label is limited to between 1 and 63 octets. A full domain name is limited to 255 octets (including the separators). The zero length full name is defined as representing the root of the DNS tree, and is typically written and displayed as “.”. Those restrictions aside, any binary string whatever can be used as the label of any resource record. Similarly, any binary string can serve as the value of any record that includes a domain name as some or all of its value (SOA, NS, MX, PTR, CNAME, and any others that may be added). Implementations of the DNS protocols must not place any restrictions on the labels that can be used. In particular, DNS servers must not refuse to serve a zone because it contains labels that might not be acceptable to some DNS client programs. A DNS server may be configurable to issue warnings when loading, or even to refuse to load, a primary zone containing labels that might be considered questionable, however this should not happen by default.</p>
<p>Note however, that the various applications that make use of DNS data can have restrictions imposed on what particular values are acceptable in their environment. For example, that any binary label can have an MX record does not imply that any binary name can be used as the host part of an e-mail address. Clients of the DNS can impose whatever restrictions are appropriate to their circumstances on the values they use as keys for DNS lookup requests, and on the values returned by the DNS. If the client has such restrictions, it is solely responsible for validating the data from the DNS to ensure that it conforms before it makes any use of that data.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="size-limits"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Size Limits</h2>

<h2 data-number="2.4" id="resource-records-rrs"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Resource Records (RRs)</h2>
<p>A domain name identifies a node. Each node has a set of resource information, which may be empty. The set of resource information associated with a particular name is composed of separate resource records (RRs). The order of RRs in a set is not significant, and need not be preserved by name servers, resolvers, or other parts of the DNS.</p>
<p>When we talk about a specific RR, we assume it has the following:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="textual-expression-of-rrs"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Textual Expression of RRs</h2>
<p>RRs are represented in binary form in the packets of the DNS protocol, and are usually represented in highly encoded form when stored in a name server or resolver.</p>
<p>The start of the line gives the owner of the RR. If a line begins with a blank, then the owner is assumed to be the same as that of the previous RR. Blank lines are often included for readability.</p>
<p>Following the owner, we list the TTL, type, and class of the RR. Class and type use the mnemonics defined above, and TTL is an integer before the type field. In order to avoid ambiguity in parsing, type and class mnemonics are disjoint, TTLs are integers, and the type mnemonic is always last. The IN class and TTL values are often omitted from examples in the interests of clarity.</p>
<p>The resource data or RDATA section of the RR are given using knowledge of the typical representation for the data.</p>
<p>For example, we might show the RRs carried in a message as:</p>
<pre><code>ISI.EDU.        MX      10 VENERA.ISI.EDU.
                MX      10 VAXA.ISI.EDU.
VENERA.ISI.EDU. A       128.9.0.32
                A       10.1.0.52
VAXA.ISI.EDU.   A       10.2.0.27
                A       128.9.0.33</code></pre>
<p>The MX RRs have an RDATA section which consists of a 16 bit number followed by a domain name. The address RRs use a standard IP address format to contain a 32 bit internet address.</p>
<p>This example shows six RRs, with two RRs at each of three domain names.</p>
<p>Similarly we might see:</p>
<pre><code>XX.LCS.MIT.EDU. IN      A       10.0.0.44
                CH      A       MIT.EDU. 2420</code></pre>
<p>This example shows two addresses for XX.LCS.MIT.EDU, each of a different class.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.6" id="aliases-and-canonical-names"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Aliases and Canonical Names</h2>
<p>Many resources might have multiple names that all represent the same thing. In order to not have the same data duplicated in multiple places, DNS has the Canonical Name (CNAME) RR.</p>
<p>The CNAME RR identifies its owner name as an alias for another domain name, known as the canonical name. If a CNAME is present at a node, no other data should be present.</p>
<p>When a name server of resolver is processing a query, if it happens to encounter a CNAME it should reset the query resolution to the domain name pointed to by the CNAME RR. The one exception is when queries match the CNAME type, they are not restarted.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a name server was processing a query with for USC- ISIC.ARPA, asking for type A information, and had the following resource records:</p>
<pre><code>USC-ISIC.ARPA   IN      CNAME   C.ISI.EDU

C.ISI.EDU       IN      A       10.0.0.52</code></pre>
<p>Both of these RRs would be returned in the response to the type A query, while a type CNAME or * query should return just the CNAME.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.7" id="queries"><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Queries</h2>
<p>Queries are messages which may be sent to a name server to provoke a response. In the Internet, queries are carried in UDP datagrams or over TCP connections. The response by the name server either answers the question posed in the query, refers the requester to another set of name servers, or signals some error condition.</p>
<p>In general, the user does not generate queries directly, but instead makes a request to a resolver which in turn sends one or more queries to name servers and deals with the error conditions and referrals that may result. Of course, the possible questions which can be asked in a query does shape the kind of service a resolver can provide.</p>
<p>DNS queries and responses are carried in a standard message format. The message format has a header containing a number of fixed fields which are always present, and four sections which carry query parameters and RRs.</p>
<p>The most important field in the header is a four bit field called an opcode which separates different queries. Of the possible 16 values, one (standard query) is part of the official protocol, one (status query) is optional, two (inverse and completion query) are obsolete, and the rest are unassigned.</p>
<p>The four sections are:</p>

</table>
<p>Note that the content, but not the format, of these sections varies with header opcode.</p>
<p>The specific format of the DNS message format is described later in <a href="#dns-packet-structure">DNS Packet Structure</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.7.1" id="standard-queries"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Standard Queries</h3>
<p>A standard query specifies a target domain name (QNAME), query type (QTYPE), and query class (QCLASS) and asks for RRs which match. This type of query makes up such a vast majority of DNS queries that we use the term “query” to mean standard query unless otherwise specified. The QTYPE and QCLASS fields are each 16 bits long, and are a superset of defined types and classes.</p>
<p>Using the query domain name, QTYPE, and QCLASS, the name server looks for matching RRs. In addition to relevant records, the name server may return RRs that point toward a name server that has the desired information or RRs that are expected to be useful in interpreting the relevant RRs. For example, a name server that doesn’t have the requested information may know a name server that does; a name server that returns a domain name in a relevant RR may also return the RR that binds that domain name to an address.</p>
<p>For example, a mailer tying to send mail to Mockapetris@ISI.EDU might ask the resolver for mail information about ISI.EDU, resulting in a query for QNAME=ISI.EDU, QTYPE=MX, QCLASS=IN. The response’s answer section would be:</p>
<pre><code>ISI.EDU.        MX      10 VENERA.ISI.EDU.
                MX      10 VAXA.ISI.EDU.</code></pre>
<p>while the additional section might be:</p>
<pre><code>VAXA.ISI.EDU.   A       10.2.0.27
                A       128.9.0.33
VENERA.ISI.EDU. A       10.1.0.52
                A       128.9.0.32</code></pre>
<p>Because the server assumes that if the requester wants mail exchange information, it will probably want the addresses of the mail exchanges soon afterward.</p>
<p>Note that the QCLASS=* construct requires special interpretation regarding authority. Since a particular name server may not know all of the classes available in the domain system, it can never know if it is authoritative for all classes. Hence responses to QCLASS=* queries can never be authoritative.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.7.2" id="inverse-queries-obsolete"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Inverse Queries (Obsolete)</h3>
<p>The IQUERY operation was, historically, largely unimplemented in most name server/resolver software. In addition to this widespread disuse, the problems stated below made the entire concept widely considered unwise and poorly thoughtout. Also, the widely used alternate approach of using pointer (PTR) queries and reverse-mapped records is preferable. Consequently <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3425.txt">RFC-3425</a> declared it entirely obsolete. As such, any name server or resolver receiving an IQUERY should return a “Not Implemented” error.</p>
<p>As specified in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a> (section 6.4), the IQUERY operation for DNS queries is used to look up the name(s) which are associated with the given value. The value being sought is provided in the query’s answer section and the response fills in the question section with one or more 3-tuples of type, name and class.</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a>, (section 6.4.3), inverse query processing can put quite an arduous burden on a server. A server would need to perform either an exhaustive search of its database or maintain a separate database that is keyed by the values of the primary database. Both of these approaches could strain system resource use, particularly for servers that are authoritative for millions of names.</p>
<p>Response packets from these megaservers could be exceptionally large, and easily run into megabyte sizes. For example, using IQUERY to find every domain that is delegated to one of the name servers of a large ISP could return tens of thousands of 3-tuples in the question section. This could easily be used to launch denial of service attacks.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="name-servers"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Name Servers</h1>
<p>Name servers are the repositories of information that make up the domain database. The database is divided up into sections called zones, which are distributed among the name servers. While name servers can have several optional functions and sources of data, the essential task of a name server is to answer queries using data in its zones. By design, name servers can answer queries in a simple manner; the response can always be generated using only local data, and either contains the answer to the question or a referral to other name servers “closer” to the desired information.</p>
<p>A given zone will be available from several name servers to insure its availability in spite of host or communication link failure. By administrative fiat, we require every zone to be available on at least two servers, and many zones have more redundancy than that.</p>
<p>A given name server will typically support one or more zones, but this gives it authoritative information about only a small section of the domain tree. It may also have some cached non-authoritative data about other parts of the tree. The name server marks its responses to queries so that the requester can tell whether the response comes from authoritative data or not.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="how-the-database-is-divided-into-zones"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> How the Database is Divided into Zones</h2>
<p>The domain database is divided in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Class</li>
<li>Zones</li>
</ol>
<p>The class partition is simple, just imagine each class as a seperate yet parallel namespace tree.</p>
<p>Within a class, “cuts” are made between any two adjacent nodes. Each group of connected nodes forms a “zone”. The zone is authoritative for all names in the connected region. Note that the “cuts” in the namespace tree may be different for different classes.</p>
<p>The name of the node closest to the root node is often used to identify the zone itself.</p>
<p>Generally, these cuts are made at points where different orginizations are willing to take ownership of a subtree, or where an orginization wants to make further internal partitions.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.1.1" id="zone-cuts"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Zone Cuts</h3>
<p>Each zone cut separates a “child” zone (below the cut) from a “parent” zone (above the cut). The domain name that appears at the top of a zone (just below the cut that separates the zone from its parent) is called the zone’s “origin”. The name of the zone is the same as the name of the domain at the zone’s origin. Each zone comprises that subset of the DNS tree that is at or below the zone’s origin, and that is above the cuts that separate the zone from its children (if any). The existence of a zone cut is indicated in the parent zone by the existence of NS records (and potentially NSEC, DS, and RRSIG records) specifying the origin of the child zone. A child zone does not contain any explicit reference to its parent.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.1.1.1" id="zone-authority"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1.1</span> Zone Authority</h4>
<p>The authoritative servers for a zone are enumerated in the NS records for the origin of the zone, which, along with a Start of Authority (SOA) record are the mandatory records in every zone. Such a server is authoritative for all resource records in a zone that are not in another zone. The NS records that indicate a zone cut are the property of the child zone created, as are any other records for the origin of that child zone, or any sub-domains of it. A server for a zone should not return authoritative answers for queries related to names in another zone, which includes the NS, and perhaps A, records at a zone cut, unless it also happens to be a server for the other zone.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="technical-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Technical Considerations</h2>
<p>The data that describes a zone has four major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Authoritative data for all nodes within the zone</p></li>
<li><p>Data that defines the top node of the zone (can be thought of as part of the authoritative data)</p></li>
<li><p>Data that describes delegated subzones, i.e., cuts around the bottom of the zone</p></li>
<li><p>Data that allows access to name servers for subzones (sometimes called “glue” data)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of this data is expressed in the form of RRs, so a zone can be completely described in terms of a set of RRs. Whole zones can be transferred between name servers by transferring the RRs, either carried in a series of messages or by FTPing a master file which is a textual representation.</p>
<p>The authoritative data for a zone is simply all of the RRs attached to all of the nodes from the top node of the zone down to leaf nodes or nodes above cuts around the bottom edge of the zone.</p>
<p>Though logically part of the authoritative data, the RRs that describe the top node of the zone are especially important to the zone’s management. These RRs are of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name Server (NS) RRs that list, one per RR, all of the servers for the zone</p></li>
<li><p>A single SOA RR that describes zone management parameters</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The RRs that describe cuts around the bottom of the zone are NS RRs that name the servers for the subzones. Since the cuts are between nodes, these RRs are NOT part of the authoritative data of the zone, and should be exactly the same as the corresponding RRs in the top node of the subzone. Since name servers are always associated with zone boundaries, NS RRs are only found at nodes which are the top node of some zone. In the data that makes up a zone, NS RRs are found at the top node of the zone (and are authoritative) and at cuts around the bottom of the zone (where they are not authoritative), but never in between.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the zone structure is that any zone have all the data required to set up communications with the name servers for any subzones. That is, parent zones have all the information needed to access servers for their children zones. The NS RRs that name the servers for subzones are often not enough for this task since they name the servers, but do not give their addresses. In particular, if the name of the name server is itself in the subzone, we could be faced with the situation where the NS RRs tell us that in order to learn a name server’s address, we should contact the server using the address we wish to learn. To fix this problem, a zone contains “glue” RRs which are not part of the authoritative data, and are address RRs for the servers. These RRs are only necessary if the name server’s name is “below” the cut, that is, under a subzone, and are only used as part of a referral response.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="name-server-internals"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Name Server Internals</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.3.1" id="queries-and-responses"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Queries and Responses</h3>
<p>The principal activity of name servers is to answer standard queries. Both the query and its response are carried in a standard message format which is described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a>. The query contains a QTYPE, QCLASS, and QNAME, which describe the types and classes of desired information and the name of interest.</p>
<p>The way that the name server answers the query depends upon whether it is operating in recursive mode or not:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The simplest mode for the server is non-recursive, since it can answer queries using only local information: the response contains an error, the answer, or a referral to some other server “closer” to the answer. All name servers must implement non-recursive queries.</p></li>
<li><p>The simplest mode for the client is recursive, since in this mode the name server acts in the role of a resolver and returns either an error or the answer, but never referrals. This service is optional in a name server, and the name server may also choose to restrict the clients which can use recursive mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Recursive service is helpful in several situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a relatively simple requester that lacks the ability to use anything other than a direct answer to the question.</p></li>
<li><p>a request that needs to cross protocol or other boundaries and can be sent to a server which can act as intermediary.</p></li>
<li><p>a network where we want to concentrate the cache rather than having a separate cache for each client.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Non-recursive service is appropriate if the requester is capable of pursuing referrals and interested in information which will aid future requests.</p>
<p>The use of recursive mode is limited to cases where both the client and the name server agree to its use. The agreement is negotiated through the use of two bits in query and response messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Recursion Available (RA) bit is set or cleared by a name server in all responses. The bit is true if the name server is willing to provide recursive service for the client, regardless of whether the client requested recursive service. That is, RA signals availability rather than use.</p></li>
<li><p>The Recursion Desired (RD) bit is set or cleared by a client in all queries. This bit specifies specifies whether the requester wants recursive service for this query. Clients may request recursive service from any name server, though they should depend upon receiving it only from servers which have previously sent an RA, or servers which have agreed to provide service through private agreement or some other means outside of the DNS protocol.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The recursive mode occurs when a query with RD set arrives at a server which is willing to provide recursive service; the client can verify that recursive mode was used by checking that both RA and RD are set in the reply. Note that the name server should never perform recursive service unless asked via RD, since this interferes with trouble shooting of name servers and their databases.</p>
<p>If recursive service is requested and available, the recursive response to a query will be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The answer to the query, possibly preface by one or more CNAME RRs that specify aliases encountered on the way to an answer.</p></li>
<li><p>A name error indicating that the name does not exist. This may include CNAME RRs that indicate that the original query name was an alias for a name which does not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>A temporary error indication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If recursive service is not requested or is not available, the non- recursive response will be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An authoritative name error indicating that the name does not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>A temporary error indication.</p></li>
<li><p>Some combination of:</p>
<p>RRs that answer the question, together with an indication whether the data comes from a zone or is cached.</p>
<p>A referral to name servers which have zones which are closer ancestors to the name than the server sending the reply.</p></li>
<li><p>RRs that the name server thinks will prove useful to the requester.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="3.3.2" id="server-reply-source-address-and-port-number-selection"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Server Reply Source Address and Port Number Selection</h3>
<p>Most, if not all, DNS clients and name servers expect the address from which a reply is received to be the same addres as that to which the query eliciting the reply was sent. The address, along with the identifier (ID) in the reply is used for disambiguating replies, and filtering spurious responses. This may, or may not, have been intended when the DNS was designed, but is now a fact of life.</p>
<p>If a multi-homed host running a DNS server generates replies using a source address that is not the same as the destination adress from the client’s request packet, the reply would be discarded by the client due to being seen as a spurious response. Because of this, DNS responses over UDP MUST use the same IP address as the destination IP specified in the original UDP query.</p>
<p>Replies should also always be sent from the port to which they were directed. Replies should also use the source port of the question as the destination port of the response.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.3.3" id="name-server-algorithm"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Name Server Algorithm</h3>
<p>The actual algorithm used by the name server will depend on the local OS and data structures used to store RRs. The following algorithm assumes that the RRs are organized in several tree structures, one for each zone, and another for the cache:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Set or clear the value of recursion available in the response depending on whether the name server is willing to provide recursive service. If recursive service is available and requested via the RD bit in the query, go to step 5, otherwise step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Search the available zones for the zone which is the nearest ancestor to QNAME. If such a zone is found, go to step 3, otherwise step 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Start matching down, label by label, in the zone. The matching process can terminate several ways:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If the whole of QNAME is matched, we have found the node.</p>
<p>If the data at the node is a CNAME, and QTYPE doesn’t match CNAME, copy the CNAME RR into the answer section of the response, change QNAME to the canonical name in the CNAME RR, and go back to step 1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, copy all RRs which match QTYPE into the answer section and go to step 6.</p></li>
<li><p>If a match would take us out of the authoritative data, we have a referral. This happens when we encounter a node with NS RRs marking cuts along the bottom of a zone.</p>
<p>Copy the NS RRs for the subzone into the authority section of the reply. Put whatever addresses are available into the additional section, using glue RRs if the addresses are not available from authoritative data or the cache. Go to step 4.</p></li>
<li><p>If at some label, a match is impossible (i.e., the corresponding label does not exist), look to see if a the * label exists.</p>
<p>If the “*” label does not exist, set an authoritative name error in the response and exit. Otherwise just exit.</p>
<p>If the “*” label does exist, match RRs at that node against QTYPE. If any match, copy them into the answer section, but set the owner of the RR to be QNAME or the name of the CNAME we have followed, and not the node with the “*” label. Go to step 6.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Start matching down in the cache. If QNAME is found in the cache, copy all RRs attached to it that match QTYPE into the answer section. If there was no delegation from authoritative data, look for the best one from the cache, and put it in the authority section. Go to step 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the local resolver or a copy of its algorithm (see resolver section of this memo) to answer the query. Store the results, including any intermediate CNAMEs, in the answer section of the response.</p></li>
<li><p>Using local data only, attempt to add other RRs which may be useful to the additional section of the query. Exit.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 data-number="3.3.4" id="wildcards"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Wildcards</h3>
<p>In the previous algorithm, special treatment was given to RRs with owner names starting with the label *. Such RRs are called wildcards. Wildcard RRs can be thought of as instructions for synthesizing RRs. When the appropriate conditions are met, the name server creates RRs with an owner name equal to the query name and contents taken from the wildcard RRs.</p>
<p>This facility is most often used to create a zone which will be used to forward mail from the Internet to some other mail system. The general idea is that any name in that zone which is presented to server in a query will be assumed to exist, with certain properties, unless explicit evidence exists to the contrary. Note that the use of the term zone here, instead of domain, is intentional; such defaults do not propagate across zone boundaries, although a subzone may choose to achieve that appearance by setting up similar defaults.</p>
<p>The contents of the wildcard RRs follows the usual rules and formats for RRs. The wildcards in the zone have an owner name that controls the query names they will match. The owner name of the wildcard RRs is of the form “*.&lt;anydomain&gt;”, where &lt;anydomain&gt; is any domain name. &lt;anydomain&gt; should not contain other “*” labels, and should be in the authoritative data of the zone. The wildcards potentially apply to descendants of &lt;anydomain&gt;, but not to &lt;anydomain&gt; itself. Another way to look at this is that the “*” label always matches at least one whole label and sometimes more, but always whole labels.</p>
<p>Wildcard RRs do not apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the query is in another zone. That is, delegation cancels the wildcard defaults.</p></li>
<li><p>When the query name or a name between the wildcard domain and the query name is known to exist. For example, if a wildcard RR has an owner name of *.X, and the zone also contains RRs attached to B.X, the wildcards would apply to queries for name Z.X (presuming there is no explicit information for Z.X), but not to B.X, A.B.X, or X.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A “*” label appearing in a query name has no special effect, but can be used to test for wildcards in an authoritative zone; such a query is the only way to get a response containing RRs with an owner name with "*" in it. The result of such a query should not be cached.</p>
<p>Note that the contents of the wildcard RRs are not modified when used to synthesize RRs.</p>
<p>To illustrate the use of wildcard RRs, suppose a large company with a large, non-IP/TCP, network wanted to create a mail gateway. If the company was called X.COM, and IP/TCP capable gateway machine was called A.X.COM, the following RRs might be entered into the COM zone:</p>
<pre><code>X.COM           MX      10      A.X.COM

*.X.COM         MX      10      A.X.COM

A.X.COM         A       1.2.3.4
A.X.COM         MX      10      A.X.COM

*.A.X.COM       MX      10      A.X.COM</code></pre>
<p>This would cause any MX query for any domain name ending in X.COM to return an MX RR pointing at A.X.COM. Two wildcard RRs are required since the effect of the wildcard at *.X.COM is inhibited in the A.X.COM subtree by the explicit data for A.X.COM. Note also that the explicit MX data at X.COM and A.X.COM is required, and that none of the RRs above would match a query name of XX.COM.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.3.5" id="negative-response-caching"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5</span> Negative Response Caching</h3>
<p>Originally, negative response caching was an optional behaviour for recursive and authoritative name servers. However, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2308.txt">RFC-2308</a> clarified this behavior and made it mandatory.</p>
<p>The most common negative responses indicate that a particular RRset does not exist in the DNS. The first parts of this section deal with this case. Other negative responses can indicate failures of a nameserver, those are dealt with in the Other Negative Responses section.</p>
<p>A negative response is indicated by one of the following conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Name Error (NXDOMAIN)</li>
<li>No Data (NODATA)</li>
</ol>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.1" id="name-error-nxdomain"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.1</span> Name Error (NXDOMAIN)</h4>
<p>Name errors (NXDOMAIN) are indicated by the presence of “Name Error” in the RCODE field. In this case the domain referred to by the QNAME does not exist. Note: the answer section may have RRSIG and CNAME RRs and the authority section may have SOA, NSEC, and RRSIG RRs.</p>
<p>It is possible to distinguish between a referral and a NXDOMAIN response by the presense of NXDOMAIN in the RCODE regardless of the presence of NS or SOA records in the authority section.</p>
<p>NXDOMAIN responses can be categorised into four types by the contents of the authority section. These are shown below along with a referral for comparison. Fields not mentioned are not important in terms of the examples.</p>
<pre><code>NXDOMAIN RESPONSE: TYPE 1.

<p>Note, in the four examples of NXDOMAIN responses, it is known that the name “AN.EXAMPLE.” exists, and has as its value a CNAME record. The NXDOMAIN refers to “TRIPPLE.XX”, which is then known not to exist. On the other hand, in the referral example, it is shown that “AN.EXAMPLE” exists, and has a CNAME RR as its value, but nothing is known one way or the other about the existence of “TRIPPLE.XX”, other than that “NS1.XX” or “NS2.XX” can be consulted as the next step in obtaining information about it.</p>
<p>Where no CNAME records appear, the NXDOMAIN response refers to the name in the label of the RR in the question section.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.2" id="no-data-nodata"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.2</span> No Data (NODATA)</h4>
<p>NODATA is indicated by an answer with the RCODE set to NOERROR and no relevant answers in the answer section. The authority section will contain an SOA record, or there will be no NS records there.</p>
<p>NODATA responses have to be algorithmically determined from the response’s contents as there is no RCODE value to indicate NODATA. In some cases to determine with certainty that NODATA is the correct response it can be necessary to send another query.</p>
<p>The authority section may contain NSEC and RRSIG RRsets in addition to NS and SOA records. CNAME and RRSIG records may exist in the answer section.</p>
<p>It is possible to distinguish between a NODATA and a referral response by the presence of a SOA record in the authority section or the absence of NS records in the authority section.</p>
<p>NODATA responses can be categorised into three types by the contents of the authority section. These are shown below along with a referral for comparison. Fields not mentioned are not important in terms of the examples.</p>
<pre><code>NODATA RESPONSE: TYPE 1.

<p>These examples, unlike the NXDOMAIN examples above, have no CNAME records, however they could, in just the same way that the NXDOMAIN examples did, in which case it would be the value of the last CNAME (the QNAME) for which NODATA would be concluded.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.3" id="negative-answers-from-authoritative-servers"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.3</span> Negative Answers from Authoritative Servers</h4>
<p>Name servers authoritative for a zone MUST include the SOA record of the zone in the authority section of the response when reporting an NXDOMAIN or indicating that no data of the requested type exists. This is required so that the response may be cached. The TTL of this record is set from the minimum of the MINIMUM field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself, and indicates how long a resolver may cache the negative answer. The TTL SIG record associated with the SOA record should also be trimmed in line with the SOA’s TTL.</p>
<p>If the containing zone is signed, the SOA and appropriate NSEC and RRSIG records MUST be added.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.4" id="soa-minimum-field"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.4</span> SOA Minimum Field</h4>
<p>The SOA minimum field has been overloaded in the past to have three different meanings, the minimum TTL value of all RRs in a zone, the default TTL of RRs which did not contain a TTL value and the TTL of negative responses.</p>
<p>Despite being the original defined meaning, the first of these, the minimum TTL value of all RRs in a zone, has never in practice been used and is hereby deprecated.</p>
<p>The second, the default TTL of RRs which contain no explicit TTL in the master zone file, is relevant only at the primary server. After a zone transfer all RRs have explicit TTLs and it is impossible to determine whether the TTL for a record was explicitly set or derived from the default after a zone transfer. Where a server does not require RRs to include the TTL value explicitly, it should provide a mechanism, not being the value of the MINIMUM field of the SOA record, from which the missing TTL values are obtained. How this is done is implementation dependent.</p>
<p>The Master File format (see Master File section) is extended to include the following directive:</p>
<pre><code>$TTL &lt;TTL&gt; [comment]</code></pre>
<p>All resource records appearing after the directive, and which do not explicitly include a TTL value, have their TTL set to the TTL given in the $TTL directive.</p>
<p>The remaining of the current meanings, of being the TTL to be used for negative responses, is the new defined meaning of the SOA minimum field.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.5" id="caching-negative-answers"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.5</span> Caching Negative Answers</h4>
<p>Like normal answers negative answers have a time to live (TTL). As there is no record in the answer section to which this TTL can be applied, the TTL must be carried by another method. This is done by including the SOA record from the zone in the authority section of the reply. When the authoritative server creates this record its TTL is taken from the minimum of the SOA.MINIMUM field and SOA’s TTL. This TTL decrements in a similar manner to a normal cached answer and upon reaching zero (0) indicates the cached negative answer MUST NOT be used again.</p>
<p>A negative answer that resulted from a name error (NXDOMAIN) should be cached such that it can be retrieved and returned in response to another query for the same &lt;QNAME, QCLASS&gt; that resulted in the cached negative response.</p>
<p>A negative answer that resulted from a no data error (NODATA) should be cached such that it can be retrieved and returned in response to another query for the same &lt;QNAME, QTYPE, QCLASS&gt; that resulted in the cached negative response.</p>
<p>The NXT record, if it exists in the authority section of a negative answer received, MUST be stored such that it can be be located and returned with SOA record in the authority section, as should any SIG records in the authority section. For NXDOMAIN answers there is no “necessary” obvious relationship between the NXT records and the QNAME. The NXT record MUST have the same owner name as the query name for NODATA responses.</p>
<p>Negative responses without SOA records SHOULD NOT be cached as there is no way to prevent the negative responses looping forever between a pair of servers even with a short TTL.</p>
<p>Despite the DNS forming a tree of servers, with various mis- configurations it is possible to form a loop in the query graph, e.g. two servers listing each other as forwarders, various lame server configurations. Without a TTL count down a cache negative response when received by the next server would have its TTL reset. This negative indication could then live forever circulating between the servers involved.</p>
<p>As with caching positive responses it is sensible for a resolver to limit for how long it will cache a negative response as the protocol supports caching for up to 68 years. Such a limit should not be greater than that applied to positive answers and preferably be tunable. Values of one to three hours have been found to work well and would make sensible a default. Values exceeding one day have been found to be problematic.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.6" id="negative-answers-from-the-cache"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.6</span> Negative Answers from the Cache</h4>
<p>When a server, in answering a query, encounters a cached negative response it MUST add the cached SOA record to the authority section of the response with the TTL decremented by the amount of time it was stored in the cache. This allows the NXDOMAIN / NODATA response to time out correctly.</p>
<p>If a NXT record was cached along with SOA record it MUST be added to the authority section. If a SIG record was cached along with a NXT record it SHOULD be added to the authority section.</p>
<p>As with all answers coming from the cache, negative answers SHOULD have an implicit referral built into the answer. This enables the resolver to locate an authoritative source. An implicit referral is characterised by NS records in the authority section referring the resolver towards a authoritative source. NXDOMAIN types 1 and 4 responses contain implicit referrals as does NODATA type 1 response.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.5.7" id="other-negative-responses"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.7</span> Other Negative Responses</h4>
<p>Caching of other negative responses is not covered by any existing RFC. There is no way to indicate a desired TTL in these responses. Care needs to be taken to ensure that there are not forwarding loops.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.3.5.7.1" id="server-failure-optional"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.7.1</span> Server Failure (OPTIONAL)</h5>
<p>Server failures fall into two major classes. The first is where a server can determine that it has been misconfigured for a zone. This may be where it has been listed as a server, but not configured to be a server for the zone, or where it has been configured to be a server for the zone, but cannot obtain the zone data for some reason. This can occur either because the zone file does not exist or contains errors, or because another server from which the zone should have been available either did not respond or was unable or unwilling to supply the zone.</p>
<p>The second class is where the server needs to obtain an answer from elsewhere, but is unable to do so, due to network failures, other servers that don’t reply, or return server failure errors, or similar.</p>
<p>In either case a resolver MAY cache a server failure response. If it does so it MUST NOT cache it for longer than five (5) minutes, and it MUST be cached against the specific query tuple &lt;query name, type, class, server IP address&gt;.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.3.5.7.2" id="dead-unreachable-server-optional"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5.7.2</span> Dead / Unreachable Server (OPTIONAL)</h5>
<p>Dead / Unreachable servers are servers that fail to respond in any way to a query or where the transport layer has provided an indication that the server does not exist or is unreachable. A server may be deemed to be dead or unreachable if it has not responded to an outstanding query within 120 seconds.</p>
<p>Examples of transport layer indications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICMP error messages indicating host, net or port unreachable.</li>
<li>TCP resets</li>
<li>IP stack error messages providing similar indications to those above.</li>
</ul>
<p>A server MAY cache a dead server indication. If it does so it MUST NOT be deemed dead for longer than five (5) minutes. The indication MUST be stored against query tuple &lt;query name, type, class, server IP address&gt; unless there was a transport layer indication that the server does not exist, in which case it applies to all queries to that specific IP address.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.3.6" id="zone-maintenance-and-transfers"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.6</span> Zone Maintenance and Transfers</h3>
<p>Part of the job of a zone administrator is to maintain the zones at all of the name servers which are authoritative for the zone. When the inevitable changes are made, they must be distributed to all of the name servers. While this distribution can be accomplished using FTP or some other ad hoc procedure, the preferred method is the zone transfer part of the DNS protocol.</p>
<p>The general model of automatic zone transfer or refreshing is that one of the name servers is the master or primary for the zone. Changes are coordinated at the primary, typically by editing a master file for the zone. After editing, the administrator signals the master server to load the new zone. The other non-master or secondary servers for the zone periodically check for changes (at a selectable interval) and obtain new zone copies when changes have been made.</p>
<p>To detect changes, secondaries just check the SERIAL field of the SOA for the zone. In addition to whatever other changes are made, the SERIAL field in the SOA of the zone is always advanced whenever any change is made to the zone. The advancing can be a simple increment, or could be based on the write date and time of the master file, etc. The purpose is to make it possible to determine which of two copies of a zone is more recent by comparing serial numbers. Serial number advances and comparisons use sequence space arithmetic, so there is a theoretic limit on how fast a zone can be updated, basically that old copies must die out before the serial number covers half of its 32 bit range. In practice, the only concern is that the compare operation deals properly with comparisons around the boundary between the most positive and most negative 32 bit numbers.</p>
<p>The periodic polling of the secondary servers is controlled by parameters in the SOA RR for the zone, which set the minimum acceptable polling intervals. The parameters are called REFRESH, RETRY, and EXPIRE. Whenever a new zone is loaded in a secondary, the secondary waits REFRESH seconds before checking with the primary for a new serial. If this check cannot be completed, new checks are started every RETRY seconds. The check is a simple query to the primary for the SOA RR of the zone. If the serial field in the secondary’s zone copy is equal to the serial returned by the primary, then no changes have occurred, and the REFRESH interval wait is restarted. If the secondary finds it impossible to perform a serial check for the EXPIRE interval, it must assume that its copy of the zone is obsolete an discard it.</p>
<p>When the poll shows that the zone has changed, then the secondary server must request a zone transfer via an AXFR request for the zone. The AXFR may cause an error, such as refused, but normally is answered by a sequence of response messages. The first and last messages must contain the data for the top authoritative node of the zone. Intermediate messages carry all of the other RRs from the zone, including both authoritative and non-authoritative RRs. The stream of messages allows the secondary to construct a copy of the zone. Because accuracy is essential, TCP or some other reliable protocol must be used for AXFR requests.</p>
<p>Each secondary server is required to perform the following operations against the master, but may also optionally perform these operations against other secondary servers. This strategy can improve the transfer process when the primary is unavailable due to host downtime or network problems, or when a secondary server has better network access to an “intermediate” secondary than to the primary.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="resolvers"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Resolvers</h1>
<p>Resolvers are programs that interface user programs to domain name servers. In the simplest case, a resolver receives a request from a user program (e.g., mail programs, TELNET, FTP) in the form of a subroutine call, system call etc., and returns the desired information in a form compatible with the local host’s data formats.</p>
<p>Because a resolver may need to consult several name servers, or may have the requested information in a local cache, the amount of time that a resolver will take to complete can vary quite a bit, from milliseconds to several seconds.</p>
<p>A very important goal of the resolver is to eliminate network delay and name server load from most requests by answering them from its cache of prior results. It follows that caches which are shared by multiple processes, users, machines, etc., are more efficient than non-shared caches.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="client-resolver-interface"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Client-Resolver Interface</h2>
<h3 data-number="4.1.1" id="typical-functions"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Typical Functions</h3>
<p>The client interface to the resolver is influenced by the local host’s conventions, but the typical resolver-client interface has three functions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Host name to host address translation.</p>
<p>This function is often defined to mimic a previous HOSTS.TXT based function. Given a character string, the caller wants one or more 32 bit IP addresses. Under the DNS, it translates into a request for type A RRs. Since the DNS does not preserve the order of RRs, this function may choose to sort the returned addresses or select the “best” address if the service returns only one choice to the client. Note that a multiple address return is recommended, but a single address may be the only way to emulate prior HOSTS.TXT services.</p></li>
<li><p>Host address to host name translation</p>
<p>This function will often follow the form of previous functions. Given a 32 bit IP address, the caller wants a character string. The octets of the IP address are reversed, used as name components, and suffixed with “IN-ADDR.ARPA”. A type PTR query is used to get the RR with the primary name of the host. For example, a request for the host name corresponding to IP address 1.2.3.4 looks for PTR RRs for domain name “4.3.2.1.IN-ADDR.ARPA”.</p></li>
<li><p>General lookup function</p>
<p>This function retrieves arbitrary information from the DNS, and has no counterpart in previous systems. The caller supplies a QNAME, QTYPE, and QCLASS, and wants all of the matching RRs. This function will often use the DNS format for all RR data instead of the local host’s, and returns all RR content (e.g., TTL) instead of a processed form with local quoting conventions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the resolver performs the indicated function, it usually has one of the following results to pass back to the client:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One or more RRs giving the requested data.</p>
<p>In this case the resolver returns the answer in the appropriate format.</p></li>
<li><p>A name error (NXDOMAIN).</p>
<p>This happens when the referenced name does not exist. For example, a user may have mistyped a host name.</p></li>
<li><p>A data not found error (NODATA).</p>
<p>This happens when the referenced name exists, but data of the appropriate type does not. For example, a host address function applied to a mailbox name would return this error since the name exists, but no address RR is present.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the functions for translating between host names and addresses may combine the “name error” and “data not found” error conditions into a single type of error return, but the general function should not. One reason for this is that applications may ask first for one type of information about a name followed by a second request to the same name for some other type of information; if the two errors are combined, then useless queries may slow the application.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.1.2" id="aliases"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Aliases</h3>
<p>While attempting to resolve a particular request, the resolver may find that the name in question is an alias. For example, the resolver might find that the name given for host name to address translation is an alias when it finds the CNAME RR. If possible, the alias condition should be signalled back from the resolver to the client.</p>
<p>In most cases a resolver simply restarts the query at the new name when it encounters a CNAME. However, when performing the general function, the resolver should not pursue aliases when the CNAME RR matches the query type. This allows queries which ask whether an alias is present. For example, if the query type is CNAME, the user is interested in the CNAME RR itself, and not the RRs at the name it points to.</p>
<p>Several special conditions can occur with aliases. Multiple levels of aliases should be avoided due to their lack of efficiency, but should not be signalled as an error. Alias loops and aliases which point to non-existent names should be caught and an error condition passed back to the client.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.1.3" id="temporary-failures"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Temporary Failures</h3>
<p>In a less than perfect world, all resolvers will occasionally be unable to resolve a particular request. This condition can be caused by a resolver which becomes separated from the rest of the network due to a link failure or gateway problem, or less often by coincident failure or unavailability of all servers for a particular domain.</p>
<p>It is essential that this sort of condition should not be signalled as a name or data not present error to applications. This sort of behavior is annoying to humans, and can wreak havoc when mail systems use the DNS.</p>
<p>While in some cases it is possible to deal with such a temporary problem by blocking the request indefinitely, this is usually not a good choice, particularly when the client is a server process that could move on to other tasks. The recommended solution is to always have temporary failure as one of the possible results of a resolver function, even though this may make emulation of existing HOSTS.TXT functions more difficult.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="resolver-internals"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Resolver Internals</h2>
<p>Every resolver implementation uses slightly different algorithms, and typically spends much more logic dealing with errors of various sorts than typical occurances. This section outlines a recommended basic strategy for resolver operation.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.2.1" id="stub-resolvers"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Stub Resolvers</h3>
<p>One option for implementing a resolver is to move the resolution function out of the local machine and into a name server which supports recursive queries. This can provide an easy method of providing domain service in a PC which lacks the resources to perform the resolver function, or can centralize the cache for a whole local network or organization.</p>
<p>All that the remaining stub needs is a list of name server addresses that will perform the recursive requests. This type of resolver presumably needs the information in a configuration file, since it probably lacks the sophistication to locate it in the domain database. The user also needs to verify that the listed servers will perform the recursive service; a name server is free to refuse to perform recursive services for any or all clients. The user should consult the local system administrator to find name servers willing to perform the service.</p>
<p>This type of service suffers from some drawbacks. Since the recursive requests may take an arbitrary amount of time to perform, the stub may have difficulty optimizing retransmission intervals to deal with both lost UDP packets and dead servers; the name server can be easily overloaded by too zealous a stub if it interprets retransmissions as new requests. Use of TCP may be an answer, but TCP may well place burdens on the host’s capabilities which are similar to those of a real resolver.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.2.2" id="resources"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Resources</h3>
<p>In addition to its own resources, the resolver may also have shared access to zones maintained by a local name server. This gives the resolver the advantage of more rapid access, but the resolver must be careful to never let cached information override zone data. In this discussion the term “local information” is meant to mean the union of the cache and such shared zones, with the understanding that authoritative data is always used in preference to cached data when both are present.</p>
<p>The following resolver algorithm assumes that all functions have been converted to a general lookup function, and uses the following data structures to represent the state of a request in progress in the resolver:</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2.3" id="algorithm"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Algorithm</h3>
<p>The top level algorithm has four steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>See if the answer is in local information, and if so return it to the client.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the best servers to ask.</p></li>
<li><p>Send them queries until one returns a response.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the response, either:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>if the response answers the question or contains a name error, cache the data as well as returning it back to the client.</p></li>
<li><p>if the response contains a better delegation to other servers, cache the delegation information, and go to step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>if the response shows a CNAME and that is not the answer itself, cache the CNAME, change the SNAME to the canonical name in the CNAME RR and go to step 1.</p></li>
<li><p>if the response shows a servers failure or other bizarre contents, delete the server from the SLIST and go back to step 3.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 searches the cache for the desired data. If the data is in the cache, it is assumed to be good enough for normal use. Some resolvers have an option at the user interface which will force the resolver to ignore the cached data and consult with an authoritative server. This is not recommended as the default. If the resolver has direct access to a name server’s zones, it should check to see if the desired data is present in authoritative form, and if so, use the authoritative data in preference to cached data.</p>
<p>NS RRs list the names of hosts for a zone at or above SNAME. Copy the names into SLIST. Set up their addresses using local data. It may be the case that the addresses are not available. The resolver has many choices here; the best is to start parallel resolver processes looking for the addresses while continuing onward with the addresses which are available. Obviously, the design choices and options are complicated and a function of the local host’s capabilities. The recommended priorities for the resolver designer are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bound the amount of work (packets sent, parallel processes started) so that a request can’t get into an infinite loop or start off a chain reaction of requests or queries with other implementations EVEN IF SOMEONE HAS INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED SOME DATA.</p></li>
<li><p>Get back an answer if at all possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid unnecessary transmissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the answer as quickly as possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the search for NS RRs fails, then the resolver initializes SLIST from the safety belt SBELT. The basic idea is that when the resolver has no idea what servers to ask, it should use information from a configuration file that lists several servers which are expected to be helpful. Although there are special situations, the usual choice is two of the root servers and two of the servers for the host’s domain. The reason for two of each is for redundancy. The root servers will provide eventual access to all of the domain space. The two local servers will allow the resolver to continue to resolve local names if the local network becomes isolated from the internet due to gateway or link failure.</p>
<p>In addition to the names and addresses of the servers, the SLIST data structure can be sorted to use the best servers first, and to insure that all addresses of all servers are used in a round-robin manner. The sorting can be a simple function of preferring addresses on the local network over others, or may involve statistics from past events, such as previous response times and batting averages.</p>
<p>Step 3 sends out queries until a response is received. The strategy is to cycle around all of the addresses for all of the servers with a timeout between each transmission. In practice it is important to use all addresses of a multihomed host, and too aggressive a retransmission policy actually slows response when used by multiple resolvers contending for the same name server and even occasionally for a single resolver. SLIST typically contains data values to control the timeouts and keep track of previous transmissions.</p>
<p>Step 4 involves analyzing responses. The resolver should be highly paranoid in its parsing of responses. It should also check that the response matches the query it sent using the ID field in the response.</p>
<p>The ideal answer is one from a server authoritative for the query which either gives the required data or a name error. The data is passed back to the user and entered in the cache for future use if its TTL is greater than zero.</p>
<p>If the response shows a delegation, the resolver should check to see that the delegation is “closer” to the answer than the servers in SLIST are. This can be done by comparing the match count in SLIST with that computed from SNAME and the NS RRs in the delegation. If not, the reply is bogus and should be ignored. If the delegation is valid the NS delegation RRs and any address RRs for the servers should be cached. The name servers are entered in the SLIST, and the search is restarted.</p>
<p>If the response contains a CNAME, the search is restarted at the CNAME unless the response has the data for the canonical name or if the CNAME is the answer itself.</p>

<p>The TC bit should be set in responses only when an RRSet is required as a part of the response, but could not be included in its entirety. The TC bit should not be set merely because some extra information could have been included, but there was insufficient room. This includes the results of additional section processing.

If the recipient of the reply needs the omitted data, it can construct a query for that data and send that separately.</p>
<p>Where TC is set, the partial RRSet that would not completely fit may be left in the response. When a DNS client receives a reply with TC set, it should ignore that response, and query again, using a mechanism, such as a TCP connection, that will permit larger replies.</p>

<h3 data-number="5.8.1" id="extended-label-types"><span class="header-section-number">5.8.1</span> Extended Label Types</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2671.txt">RFC-2671</a> defined DNS label type 0b01 for use as an indication for extended label types. A specific extended label type was selected by the 6 least significant bits of the first octet. Thus, extended label types were indicated by the values 64-127 (<code>0b01xxxxxx</code>) in the first octet of the label.</p>
<p>Extended label types are extremely difficult to deploy due to lack of support in clients and intermediate gateways, as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3363.txt">RFC-3363</a>, which moved <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/2673rfc.txt">RFC-2673</a> to Experimental status; and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/3364rfc.txt">RFC-3364</a>, which describes the pros and cons. As such, proposals that contemplate extended labels SHOULD weigh this deployment cost against the possibility of implementing functionality in other ways.</p>
<p>Finally, implementations MUST NOT generate or pass Binary Labels in their communications, as they are now deprecated.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.8.2" id="message-compression"><span class="header-section-number">5.8.2</span> Message Compression</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the size of messages, the domain system utilizes a compression scheme which eliminates the repetition of domain names in a message. In this scheme, an entire domain name or a list of labels at the end of a domain name is replaced with a pointer to a prior occurance of the same name.</p>
<p>The pointer takes the form of a two octet sequence:</p>
<pre><code>+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
| 1  1|                OFFSET                   |
+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+</code></pre>
<p>The first two bits are ones. This allows a pointer to be distinguished from a label, since the label must begin with two zero bits because labels are restricted to 63 octets or less. (The 10 and 01 combinations are reserved for future use.) The OFFSET field specifies an offset from the start of the message (i.e., the first octet of the ID field in the domain header). A zero offset specifies the first byte of the ID field, etc.</p>
<p>The compression scheme allows a domain name in a message to be represented as either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a sequence of labels ending in a zero octet</p></li>
<li><p>a pointer</p></li>
<li><p>a sequence of labels ending with a pointer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pointers can only be used for occurances of a domain name where the format is not class specific. If this were not the case, a name server or resolver would be required to know the format of all RRs it handled. As yet, there are no such cases, but they may occur in future RDATA formats.</p>
<p>If a domain name is contained in a part of the message subject to a length field (such as the RDATA section of an RR), and compression is used, the length of the compressed name is used in the length calculation, rather than the length of the expanded name.</p>
<p>Programs are free to avoid using pointers in messages they generate, although this will reduce datagram capacity, and may cause truncation. However all programs are required to understand arriving messages that contain pointers.</p>
<p>For example, a datagram might need to use the domain names F.ISI.ARPA, FOO.F.ISI.ARPA, ARPA, and the root. Ignoring the other fields of the message, these domain names might be represented as:</p>

<p>The WKS record is used to describe the well known services supported by a particular protocol on a particular internet address. The PROTOCOL field specifies an IP protocol number, and the bit map has one bit per port of the specified protocol. The first bit corresponds to port 0, the second to port 1, etc. If the bit map does not include a bit for a protocol of interest, that bit is assumed zero. The appropriate values and mnemonics for ports and protocols are specified in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1010.txt">RFC-1010</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if PROTOCOL=TCP (6), the 26th bit corresponds to TCP port 25 (SMTP). If this bit is set, a SMTP server should be listening on TCP port 25; if zero, SMTP service is not supported on the specified address.</p>
<p>The purpose of WKS RRs is to provide availability information for servers for TCP and UDP. If a server supports both TCP and UDP, or has multiple Internet addresses, then multiple WKS RRs are used.</p>
<p>WKS RRs cause no additional section processing.</p>
<p>In master files, both ports and protocols are expressed using mnemonics or decimal numbers.</p>

<p>Confusion about canonical names has lead to a belief that a PTR record should have exactly one RR in its RRSet. This is incorrect, the relevant section of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC-1034</a> (section 3.6.2) indicates that the value of a PTR record should be a canonical name. That is, it should not be an alias. There is no implication in that section that only one PTR record is permitted for a name. No such restriction should be inferred.</p>

<p>The OPT RR was added as a part of <a href="#edns0">EDNS(<code>0</code>)</a>. It is a resource record meant to aid in the communication of additional information and advertisement of a servers capabilities to other actors in the DNS protocol. An OPT RR is not a part of the data stored in the DNS, and is not attached to any domain name or zone. It is something generated on the fly by a DNS client or server.</p>

<p>An OPT pseudo-RR (sometimes called a meta-RR) MAY be added to the additional data section of a request.</p>
<p>The OPT RR has RR type 41.</p>
<p>If an OPT record is present in a received request, compliant responders MUST include an OPT record in their respective responses.</p>
<p>An OPT record does not carry any DNS data. It is used only to contain control information pertaining to the question-and-answer sequence of a specific transaction. OPT RRs MUST NOT be cached, forwarded, or stored in or loaded from master files.</p>
<p>The OPT RR MAY be placed anywhere within the additional data section. When an OPT RR is included within any DNS message, it MUST be the only OPT RR in that message. If a query message with more than one OPT RR is received, a FORMERR (RCODE=1) MUST be returned. The placement flexibility for the OPT RR does not override the need for the TSIG or SIG(<code>0</code>) RRs to be the last in the additional section whenever they are present.</p>

<h5 data-number="6.19.1.4.2" id="fallback"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.4.2</span> Fallback</h5>
<p>If a requestor detects that the remote end does not support EDNS(<code>0</code>), it MAY issue queries without an OPT record. It MAY cache this knowledge for a brief time in order to avoid fallback delays in the future. However, if DNSSEC or any future option using EDNS is required, no fallback should be performed, as these options are only signaled through EDNS. If an implementation detects that some servers for the zone support EDNS(<code>0</code>) while others would force the use of TCP to fetch all data, preference MAY be given to servers that support EDNS(<code>0</code>). Implementers SHOULD analyse this choice and the impact on both endpoints.</p>
<h5 data-number="6.19.1.4.3" id="requestors-payload-size"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.4.3</span> Requestor’s Payload Size</h5>
<p>The requestor’s UDP payload size (encoded in the RR CLASS field) is the number of octets of the largest UDP payload that can be reassembled and delivered in the requestor’s network stack. Note that path MTU, with or without fragmentation, could be smaller than this.</p>
<p>Values lower than 512 MUST be treated as equal to 512.</p>
<p>The requestor SHOULD place a value in this field that it can actually receive. For example, if a requestor sits behind a firewall that will block fragmented IP packets, a requestor SHOULD NOT choose a value that will cause fragmentation. Doing so will prevent large responses from being received and can cause fallback to occur. This knowledge may be auto-detected by the implementation or provided by a human administrator.</p>
<p>Note that a 512-octet UDP payload requires a 576-octet IP reassembly buffer. Choosing between 1280 and 1410 bytes for IP (v4 or v6) over Ethernet would be reasonable.</p>
<p>Where fragmentation is not a concern, use of bigger values SHOULD be considered by implementers. Implementations SHOULD use their largest configured or implemented values as a starting point in an EDNS transaction in the absence of previous knowledge about the destination server.</p>
<p>Choosing a very large value will guarantee fragmentation at the IP layer, and may prevent answers from being received due to loss of a single fragment or to misconfigured firewalls.</p>
<p>The requestor’s maximum payload size can change over time. It MUST NOT be cached for use beyond the transaction in which it is advertised.</p>
<h5 data-number="6.19.1.4.4" id="responders-payload-size"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.4.4</span> Responder’s Payload Size</h5>
<p>The responder’s maximum payload size can change over time but can reasonably be expected to remain constant between two closely spaced sequential transactions, for example, an arbitrary QUERY used as a probe to discover a responder’s maximum UDP payload size, followed immediately by an UPDATE that takes advantage of this size. This is considered preferable to the outright use of TCP for oversized requests, if there is any reason to suspect that the responder implements EDNS, and if a request will not fit in the default 512-byte payload size limit.</p>
<h5 data-number="6.19.1.4.5" id="payload-size-selection"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.4.5</span> Payload Size Selection</h5>
<p>Due to transaction overhead, it is not recommended to advertise an architectural limit as a maximum UDP payload size. Even on system stacks capable of reassembling 64 KB datagrams, memory usage at low levels in the system will be a concern. A good compromise may be the use of an EDNS maximum payload size of 4096 octets as a starting point.</p>
<p>A requestor MAY choose to implement a fallback to smaller advertised sizes to work around firewall or other network limitations. A requestor SHOULD choose to use a fallback mechanism that begins with a large size, such as 4096. If that fails, a fallback around the range of 1280-1410 bytes SHOULD be tried, as it has a reasonable chance to fit within a single Ethernet frame. Failing that, a requestor MAY choose a 512-byte packet, which with large answers may cause a TCP retry.</p>
<p>Values of less than 512 bytes MUST be treated as equal to 512 bytes.</p>
<h5 data-number="6.19.1.4.6" id="support-in-middleboxes"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.4.6</span> Support in Middleboxes</h5>
<p>In a network that carries DNS traffic, there could be active equipment other than that participating directly in the DNS resolution process (stub and caching resolvers, authoritative servers) that affects the transmission of DNS messages (e.g., firewalls, load balancers, proxies, etc.), referred to here as “middleboxes”.</p>
<p>Conformant middleboxes MUST NOT limit DNS messages over UDP to 512 bytes.</p>
<p>Middleboxes that simply forward requests to a recursive resolver MUST NOT modify and MUST NOT delete the OPT record contents in either direction.</p>
<p>Middleboxes that have additional functionality, such as answering queries or acting as intelligent forwarders, SHOULD be able to process the OPT record and act based on its contents. These middleboxes MUST consider the incoming request and any outgoing requests as separate transactions if the characteristics of the messages are different.</p>
<p>A more in-depth discussion of this type of equipment and other considerations regarding their interaction with DNS traffic is found in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5625.txt">RFC-5625</a>.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.19.1.5" id="transport-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.5</span> Transport Considerations</h4>
<p>The presence of an OPT pseudo-RR in a request should be taken as an indication that the requestor fully implements the given version of EDNS and can correctly understand any response that conforms to that feature’s specification.</p>
<p>Lack of presence of an OPT record in a request MUST be taken as an indication that the requestor does not implement any part of this specification and that the responder MUST NOT include an OPT record in its response.</p>
<p>Extended agents MUST be prepared for handling interactions with unextended clients in the face of new protocol elements and fall back gracefully to unextended DNS when needed.</p>
<p>Responders that choose not to implement the protocol extensions defined in this document MUST respond with a return code (RCODE) of FORMERR to messages containing an OPT record in the additional section and MUST NOT include an OPT record in the response.</p>
<p>If there is a problem with processing the OPT record itself, such as an option value that is badly formatted or that includes out-of-range values, a FORMERR MUST be returned. If this occurs, the response MUST include an OPT record. This is intended to allow the requestor to distinguish between servers that do not implement EDNS and format errors within EDNS.</p>
<p>The minimal response MUST be the DNS header, question section, and an OPT record. This MUST also occur when a truncated response (using the DNS header’s TC bit) is returned.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.19.1.6" id="security-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">6.19.1.6</span> Security Considerations</h4>
<p>Requestor-side specification of the maximum buffer size may open a DNS denial-of-service attack if responders can be made to send messages that are too large for intermediate gateways to forward, thus leading to potential ICMP storms between gateways and responders.</p>
<p>Announcing very large UDP buffer sizes may result in dropping of DNS messages by middleboxes (see <a href="#support-in-middleboxes">Support in Middleboxes</a>). This could cause retransmissions with no hope of success. Some devices have been found to reject fragmented UDP packets.</p>
<p>Announcing UDP buffer sizes that are too small may result in fallback to TCP with a corresponding load impact on DNS servers. This is especially important with DNSSEC, where answers are much larger.</p>

<p>The DS Resource Record refers to a DNSKEY RR and is used in the DNS DNSKEY authentication process. A DS RR refers to a DNSKEY RR by storing the key tag, algorithm number, and a digest of the DNSKEY RR. Note that while the digest should be sufficient to identify the public key, storing the key tag and key algorithm helps make the identification process more efficient. By authenticating the DS record, a resolver can authenticate the DNSKEY RR to which the DS record points. The key authentication process is described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>The DS RR and its corresponding DNSKEY RR have the same owner name, but they are stored in different locations. The DS RR appears only on the upper (parental) side of a delegation, and is authoritative data in the parent zone. For example, the DS RR for “example.com” is stored in the “com” zone (the parent zone) rather than in the “example.com” zone (the child zone). The corresponding DNSKEY RR is stored in the “example.com” zone (the child zone). This simplifies DNS zone management and zone signing but introduces special response processing requirements for the DS RR; these are described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>The type number for the DS record is 43.</p>
<p>The DS resource record is class independent.</p>
<p>The DS RR has no special TTL requirements.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.20.4" id="the-digest-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.20.4</span> The Digest Field</h3>
<p>The DS record refers to a DNSKEY RR by including a digest of that DNSKEY RR.</p>

<pre><code>digest = digest_algorithm( DNSKEY owner name | DNSKEY RDATA);

&quot;|&quot; denotes concatenation

DNSKEY RDATA = Flags | Protocol | Algorithm | Public Key.</code></pre>
<p>The size of the digest may vary depending on the digest algorithm and DNSKEY RR size. As of the time of this writing, the only defined digest algorithm is SHA-1, which produces a 20 octet digest.</p>

<p>The DS RR links the authentication chain across zone boundaries, so the DS RR requires extra care in processing. The DNSKEY RR referred to in the DS RR MUST be a DNSSEC zone key. The DNSKEY RR Flags MUST have Flags bit 7 set. If the DNSKEY flags do not indicate a DNSSEC zone key, the DS RR (and the DNSKEY RR it references) MUST NOT be used in the validation process.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.20.6" id="the-ds-rr-presentation-format"><span class="header-section-number">6.20.6</span> The DS RR Presentation Format</h3>
<p>The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:</p>
<p>The Key Tag field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.</p>
<p>The Algorithm field MUST be represented either as an unsigned decimal integer or as an algorithm mnemonic specified in Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>The Digest Type field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.</p>
<p>The Digest MUST be represented as a sequence of case-insensitive hexadecimal digits. Whitespace is allowed within the hexadecimal text.</p>

<p>The first four text fields specify the name, TTL, Class, and RR type (DS). Value 60485 is the key tag for the corresponding “dskey.example.com.” DNSKEY RR, and value 5 denotes the algorithm used by this “dskey.example.com.” DNSKEY RR. The value 1 is the algorithm used to construct the digest, and the rest of the RDATA text is the digest in hexadecimal.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.21" id="rr-type-46---rrsig"><span class="header-section-number">6.21</span> RR TYPE 46 - RRSIG</h2>
<p>DNSSEC uses public key cryptography to sign and authenticate DNS resource record sets (RRsets). Digital signatures are stored in RRSIG resource records and are used in the DNSSEC authentication process described in [x.x.x]. A validator can use these RRSIG RRs to authenticate RRsets from the zone. The RRSIG RR MUST only be used to carry verification material (digital signatures) used to secure DNS operations.</p>
<p>An RRSIG record contains the signature for an RRset with a particular name, class, and type. The RRSIG RR specifies a validity interval for the signature and uses the Algorithm, the Signer’s Name, and the Key Tag to identify the DNSKEY RR containing the public key that a validator can use to verify the signature.</p>
<p>Because every authoritative RRset in a zone must be protected by a digital signature, RRSIG RRs must be present for names containing a CNAME RR. A RRSIG and NSEC (see [x.x.x]) MUST exist for the same name as a CNAME resource record in a signed zone.</p>
<p>The Type value for the RRSIG RR type is 46.</p>
<p>The RRSIG RR is class independent.</p>
<p>An RRSIG RR MUST have the same class as the RRset it covers.</p>
<p>The TTL value of an RRSIG RR MUST match the TTL value of the RRset it covers. This is an exception to the rules for TTL values of individual RRs within a RRset (see <a href="#ttls-of-rrs-in-an-rrset">TTLs of RRs in an RRSet</a>): individual RRSIG RRs with the same owner name will have different TTL values if the RRsets they cover have different TTL values.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.21.3" id="the-labels-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.21.3</span> The Labels Field</h3>
<p>The Labels field specifies the number of labels in the original RRSIG RR owner name. The significance of this field is that a validator uses it to determine whether the answer was synthesized from a wildcard. If so, it can be used to determine what owner name was used in generating the signature.</p>
<p>To validate a signature, the validator needs the original owner name that was used to create the signature. If the original owner name contains a wildcard label ("*"), the owner name may have been expanded by the server during the response process, in which case the validator will have to reconstruct the original owner name in order to validate the signature. [x.x.x] describes how to use the Labels field to reconstruct the original owner name.</p>
<p>The value of the Labels field MUST NOT count either the null (root) label that terminates the owner name or the wildcard label (if present). The value of the Labels field MUST be less than or equal to the number of labels in the RRSIG owner name. For example, “www.example.com.” has a Labels field value of 3, and "*.example.com." has a Labels field value of 2. Root (“.”) has a Labels field value of 0.</p>
<p>Although the wildcard label is not included in the count stored in the Labels field of the RRSIG RR, the wildcard label is part of the RRset’s owner name when the signature is generated or verified.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.21.4" id="the-original-ttl-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.21.4</span> The Original TTL Field</h3>
<p>The Original TTL field specifies the TTL of the covered RRset as it appears in the authoritative zone.</p>
<p>The Original TTL field is necessary because a caching resolver decrements the TTL value of a cached RRset. In order to validate a signature, a validator requires the original TTL. [x.x.x] describes how to use the Original TTL field value to reconstruct the original TTL.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.21.5" id="the-signature-expiration-and-inception-fields"><span class="header-section-number">6.21.5</span> The Signature Expiration and Inception Fields</h3>
<p>The Signature Expiration and Inception fields specify a validity period for the signature. The RRSIG record MUST NOT be used for authentication prior to the inception date and MUST NOT be used for authentication after the expiration date.</p>
<p>The Signature Expiration and Inception field values specify a date and time in the form of a 32-bit unsigned number of seconds elapsed since <code>1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC</code>, ignoring leap seconds, in network byte order. The longest interval that can be expressed by this format without wrapping is approximately 136 years. An RRSIG RR can have an Expiration field value that is numerically smaller than the Inception field value if the expiration field value is near the 32-bit wrap-around point or if the signature is long lived. Because of this, all comparisons involving these fields MUST use “Serial number arithmetic”, as defined in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc1982.txt">RFC-1982</a>.

<h3 data-number="6.21.8" id="the-signature-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.21.8</span> The Signature Field</h3>
<p>The Signature field contains the cryptographic signature that covers the RRSIG RDATA (excluding the Signature field) and the RRset specified by the RRSIG owner name, RRSIG class, and RRSIG Type Covered field.

        the Signature field excluded;

    RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA

        &quot;owner&quot; is the fully qualified owner name of the RRset in
        canonical form (for RRs with wildcard owner names, the
        wildcard label is included in the owner name);

        Each RR MUST have the same owner name as the RRSIG RR;

        Each RR MUST have the same class as the RRSIG RR;

        Each RR in the RRset MUST have the RR type listed in the

<p>The Algorithm field value MUST be represented either as an unsigned decimal integer or as an algorithm mnemonic, as specified in Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>The Labels field value MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.</p>
<p>The Original TTL field value MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.</p>
<p>The Signature Expiration Time and Inception Time field values MUST be represented either as an unsigned decimal integer indicating seconds since <code>1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC</code>, or in the form YYYYMMDDHHmmSS in UTC, where:</p>
<pre><code>YYYY is the year (0001-9999, but see Section 3.1.5);
MM is the month number (01-12);
DD is the day of the month (01-31);
HH is the hour, in 24 hour notation (00-23);
mm is the minute (00-59); and
SS is the second (00-59).</code></pre>
<p>Note that it is always possible to distinguish between these two formats because the YYYYMMDDHHmmSS format will always be exactly 14 digits, while the decimal representation of a 32-bit unsigned integer can never be longer than 10 digits.</p>
<p>The Key Tag field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.</p>
<p>The Signer’s Name field value MUST be represented as a domain name.</p>
<p>The Signature field is represented as a Base64 encoding of the signature. Whitespace is allowed within the Base64 text. See <a href="#the-dnskey-rr-presentation-format">The DNSKEY RR Presentation Format</a></p>

<p>The first four fields specify the owner name, TTL, Class, and RR type (RRSIG). The “A” represents the Type Covered field. The value 5 identifies the algorithm used (RSA/SHA1) to create the signature. The value 3 is the number of Labels in the original owner name. The value 86400 in the RRSIG RDATA is the Original TTL for the covered A RRset. 20030322173103 and 20030220173103 are the expiration and inception dates, respectively. 2642 is the Key Tag, and example.com. is the Signer’s Name. The remaining text is a Base64 encoding of the signature.</p>
<p>Note that combination of RRSIG RR owner name, class, and Type Covered indicates that this RRSIG covers the “host.example.com” A RRset. The Label value of 3 indicates that no wildcard expansion was used. The Algorithm, Signer’s Name, and Key Tag indicate that this signature can be authenticated using an example.com zone DNSKEY RR whose algorithm is 5 and whose key tag is 2642</p>

<p>The NSEC resource record lists two separate things: the next owner name (in the canonical ordering of the zone) that contains authoritative data or a delegation point NS RRset, and the set of RR types present at the NSEC RR’s owner name. The complete set of NSEC RRs in a zone indicates which authoritative RRsets exist in a zone and also form a chain of authoritative owner names in the zone. This information is used to provide authenticated denial of existence for DNS data, as described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>Because every authoritative name in a zone must be part of the NSEC chain, NSEC RRs must be present for names containing a CNAME RR. This is a change to the traditional DNS specification <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC-1034</a>, which stated that if a CNAME is present for a name, it is the only type allowed at that name. An RRSIG (see Section 3) and NSEC MUST exist for the same name as does a CNAME resource record in a signed zone.</p>
<p>See [x.x.x] for discussion of how a zone signer determines precisely which NSEC RRs it has to include in a zone.</p>
<p>The type value for the NSEC RR is 47.</p>
<p>The NSEC RR is class independent.</p>
<p>The NSEC RR SHOULD have the same TTL value as the SOA minimum TTL field. This is in the spirit of negative caching (see <a href="#negative-response-caching">Negative Response Caching</a>).</p>
<h3 data-number="6.22.1" id="the-next-domain-name-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.22.1</span> The Next Domain Name Field</h3>
<p>The Next Domain field contains the next owner name (in the canonical ordering of the zone) that has authoritative data or contains a delegation point NS RRset; see [x.x.x] for an explanation of canonical ordering. The value of the Next Domain Name field in the last NSEC record in the zone is the name of the zone apex (the owner name of the zone’s SOA RR). This indicates that the owner name of the NSEC RR is the last name in the canonical ordering of the zone.</p>
<p>A sender MUST NOT use DNS name compression on the Next Domain Name field when transmitting an NSEC RR.</p>
<p>Owner names of RRsets for which the given zone is not authoritative (such as glue records) MUST NOT be listed in the Next Domain Name unless at least one authoritative RRset exists at the same owner name.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.22.2" id="the-type-bit-maps-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.22.2</span> The Type Bit Maps Field</h3>
<p>The Type Bit Maps field identifies the RRset types that exist at the NSEC RR’s owner name.</p>
<p>The RR type space is split into 256 window blocks, each representing the low-order 8 bits of the 16-bit RR type space. Each block that has at least one active RR type is encoded using a single octet window number (from 0 to 255), a single octet bitmap length (from 1 to 32) indicating the number of octets used for the window block’s bitmap, and up to 32 octets (256 bits) of bitmap.</p>
<p>Blocks are present in the NSEC RR RDATA in increasing numerical order.</p>
<pre><code>Type Bit Maps Field = ( Window Block # | Bitmap Length | Bitmap )+

where &quot;|&quot; denotes concatenation.</code></pre>
<p>Each bitmap encodes the low-order 8 bits of RR types within the window block, in network bit order. The first bit is bit 0. For window block 0, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 1 (A), bit 2 corresponds to RR type 2 (NS), and so forth. For window block 1, bit 1 corresponds to RR type 257, and bit 2 to RR type 258. If a bit is set, it indicates that an RRset of that type is present for the NSEC RR’s owner name. If a bit is clear, it indicates that no RRset of that type is present for the NSEC RR’s owner name.</p>
<p>Bits representing pseudo-types MUST be clear, as they do not appear in zone data. If encountered, they MUST be ignored upon being read.</p>
<p>Blocks with no types present MUST NOT be included. Trailing zero octets in the bitmap MUST be omitted. The length of each block’s bitmap is determined by the type code with the largest numerical value, within that block, among the set of RR types present at the NSEC RR’s owner name. Trailing zero octets not specified MUST be interpreted as zero octets.</p>
<p>The bitmap for the NSEC RR at a delegation point requires special attention. Bits corresponding to the delegation NS RRset and the RR types for which the parent zone has authoritative data MUST be set; bits corresponding to any non-NS RRset for which the parent is not authoritative MUST be clear.</p>
<p>A zone MUST NOT include an NSEC RR for any domain name that only holds glue records.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.22.3" id="inclusion-of-wildcard-names-in-nsec-rdata"><span class="header-section-number">6.22.3</span> Inclusion of Wildcard Names in NSEC RDATA</h3>
<p>If a wildcard owner name appears in a zone, the wildcard label ("*") is treated as a literal symbol and is treated the same as any other owner name for the purposes of generating NSEC RRs. Wildcard owner names appear in the Next Domain Name field without any wildcard expansion. [x.x.x] describes the impact of wildcards on authenticated denial of existence.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.22.4" id="the-nsec-rr-presentation-format"><span class="header-section-number">6.22.4</span> The NSEC RR Presentation Format</h3>
<p>The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:</p>
<p>The Next Domain Name field is represented as a domain name.</p>
<p>The Type Bit Maps field is represented as a sequence of RR type mnemonics. When the mnemonic is not known, the TYPE representation described in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3579.txt">RFC-3597</a>, Section 5, MUST be used.</p>
<p>The following NSEC RR identifies the RRsets associated with alfa.example.com. and identifies the next authoritative name after alfa.example.com.</p>
<pre><code>alfa.example.com. 86400 IN NSEC host.example.com. (
                                A MX RRSIG NSEC TYPE1234 )</code></pre>
<p>The first four text fields specify the name, TTL, Class, and RR type (NSEC). The entry host.example.com. is the next authoritative name after alfa.example.com. in canonical order. The A, MX, RRSIG, NSEC, and TYPE1234 mnemonics indicate that there are A, MX, RRSIG, NSEC, and TYPE1234 RRsets associated with the name alfa.example.com.</p>
<p>The RDATA section of the NSEC RR above would be encoded as:</p>
<pre><code>    0x04 &#39;h&#39;  &#39;o&#39;  &#39;s&#39;  &#39;t&#39;
    0x07 &#39;e&#39;  &#39;x&#39;  &#39;a&#39;  &#39;m&#39;  &#39;p&#39;  &#39;l&#39;  &#39;e&#39;

<p>Assuming that the validator can authenticate this NSEC record, it could be used to prove that beta.example.com does not exist, or to prove that there is no AAAA record associated with alfa.example.com. Authenticated denial of existence is discussed in [x.x.x].</p>

<p>DNSSEC uses public key cryptography to sign and authenticate DNS resource record sets (RRsets). The public keys are stored in DNSKEY resource records and are used in the DNSSEC authentication process described in [x.x.x]: A zone signs its authoritative RRsets by using a private key and stores the corresponding public key in a DNSKEY RR. A resolver can then use the public key to validate signatures covering the RRsets in the zone, and thus to authenticate them.</p>
<p>The DNSKEY RR is not intended as a record for storing arbitrary public keys and MUST NOT be used to store certificates or public keys that do not directly relate to the DNS infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Type value for the DNSKEY RR type is 48.</p>
<p>The DNSKEY RR is class independent.</p>
<p>The DNSKEY RR has no special TTL requirements.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.23.1" id="the-flags-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.23.1</span> The Flags Field</h3>
<p>Bit 7 of the Flags field is the Zone Key flag. If bit 7 has value 1, then the DNSKEY record holds a DNS zone key, and the DNSKEY RR’s owner name MUST be the name of a zone. If bit 7 has value 0, then the DNSKEY record holds some other type of DNS public key and MUST NOT be used to verify RRSIGs that cover RRsets.</p>
<p>Bit 15 of the Flags field is the Secure Entry Point (SEP) flag, described in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3757.txt">RFC-3757</a>. If bit 15 has value 1, then the DNSKEY record holds a key intended for use as a secure entry point. This flag is only intended to be a hint to zone signing or debugging software as to the intended use of this DNSKEY record; validators MUST NOT alter their behavior during the signature validation process in any way based on the setting of this bit. This also means that a DNSKEY RR with the SEP bit set would also need the Zone Key flag set in order to be able to generate signatures legally. A DNSKEY RR with the SEP set and the Zone Key flag not set MUST NOT be used to verify RRSIGs that cover RRsets.</p>
<p>Bits 0-6 and 8-14 are reserved: these bits MUST have value 0 upon creation of the DNSKEY RR and MUST be ignored upon receipt.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.23.2" id="the-protocol-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.23.2</span> The Protocol Field</h3>
<p>The Protocol Field MUST have value 3, and the DNSKEY RR MUST be treated as invalid during signature verification if it is found to be some value other than 3.</p>
<p>Although the Protocol Field always has value 3, it is retained for backward compatibility with early versions of the KEY record.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.23.3" id="the-algorithm-field-2"><span class="header-section-number">6.23.3</span> The Algorithm Field</h3>
<p>The Algorithm field identifies the public key’s cryptographic algorithm and determines the format of the Public Key field. A list of DNSSEC algorithm types can be found in [x.x.x].</p>
<h3 data-number="6.23.4" id="the-public-key-field"><span class="header-section-number">6.23.4</span> The Public Key Field</h3>

<h3 data-number="6.23.5" id="the-dnskey-rr-presentation-format"><span class="header-section-number">6.23.5</span> The DNSKEY RR Presentation Format</h3>
<p>The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:</p>
<p>The Flag field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer. Given the currently defined flags, the possible values are: 0, 256, and 257.</p>
<p>The Protocol Field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer with a value of 3.</p>
<p>The Algorithm field MUST be represented either as an unsigned decimal integer or as an algorithm mnemonic as specified in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>The Public Key field MUST be represented as a Base64 encoding of the Public Key. Whitespace is allowed within the Base64 text. For a definition of Base64 encoding, see <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3548.txt">RFC-3548</a>.</p>
<p>The following DNSKEY RR stores a DNS zone key for example.com.</p>
<p>example.com. 86400 IN DNSKEY 256 3 5 ( AQPSKmynfzW4kyBv015MUG2DeIQ3 Cbl+BBZH4b/0PY1kxkmvHjcZc8no kfzj31GajIQKY+5CptLr3buXA10h WqTkF7H6RfoRqXQeogmMHfpftf6z Mv1LyBUgia7za6ZEzOJBOztyvhjL 742iU/TpPSEDhm2SNKLijfUppn1U aNvv4w== )</p>
<p>The first four text fields specify the owner name, TTL, Class, and RR type (DNSKEY). Value 256 indicates that the Zone Key bit (bit 7) in the Flags field has value 1. Value 3 is the fixed Protocol value. Value 5 indicates the public key algorithm. [x.x.x] identifies algorithm type 5 as RSA/SHA1 and indicates that the format of the RSA/SHA1 public key field is defined in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3110.txt">RFC-3110</a>. The remaining text is a Base64 encoding of the public key.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.24" id="resource-record-sets"><span class="header-section-number">6.24</span> Resource Record Sets</h2>
<p>Each resource record has a label, class, type, and data. It is meaningless for two records to ever have label, class, type, and data to all be equal - servers should suppress such duplicates if encountered. It is however possible for most record types to exist with the same label, class, and type, but with different data. Such a group of records is defines as a Resource Record Set (RRSet).</p>
<h3 data-number="6.24.1" id="ttls-of-rrs-in-an-rrset"><span class="header-section-number">6.24.1</span> TTLs of RRs in an RRSet</h3>
<p>The TTLs of all RRs in an RRSet MUST be the same.</p>
<p>Should a client receive a response containing RRs from an RRSet with differing TTLs, it should treat this as an error. If the RRSet concerned is from a non-authoritative source for this data, the client should simply ignore the RRSet, and if the values were required, seek to acquire them from an authoritative source. Clients that are configured to send all queries to one, or more, particular servers should treat those servers as authoritative for this purpose. Should an authoritative source send such a malformed RRSet, the client should treat the RRs for all purposes as if all TTLs in the RRSet had been set to the value of the lowest TTL in the RRSet.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.24.2" id="receiving-rrsets"><span class="header-section-number">6.24.2</span> Receiving RRSets</h3>
<p>Servers must never merge RRs from a response with RRs in their cache to form an RRSet. If a response contains data that would form an RRSet with data in a server’s cache the server must either ignore the RRs in the response, or discard the entire RRSet currently in the cache, as appropriate. Consequently the issue of TTLs varying between the cache and a response does not cause concern, one will be ignored. That is, one of the data sets is always incorrect if the data from an answer differs from the data in the cache. The challenge for the server is to determine which of the data sets is correct, if one is, and retain that, while ignoring the other. Note that if a server receives an answer containing an RRSet that is identical to that in its cache, with the possible exception of the TTL value, it may, optionally, update the TTL in its cache with the TTL of the received answer. It should do this if the received answer would be considered more authoritative (as discussed in the next section) than the previously cached answer.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.24.2.1" id="ranking-data"><span class="header-section-number">6.24.2.1</span> Ranking Data</h4>
<p>When considering whether to accept an RRSet in a reply, or retain an RRSet already in its cache instead, a server should consider the relative likely trustworthiness of the various data. An authoritative answer from a reply should replace cached data that had been obtained from additional information in an earlier reply. However additional information from a reply will be ignored if the cache contains data from an authoritative answer or a zone file.</p>
<p>The accuracy of data available is assumed from its source. Trustworthiness shall be, in order from most to least:</p>
<pre><code>+ Data from a primary zone file, other than glue data,
+ Data from a zone transfer, other than glue,
+ The authoritative data included in the answer section of an
authoritative reply.
+ Data from the authority section of an authoritative answer,
+ Glue from a primary zone, or glue from a zone transfer,
+ Data from the answer section of a non-authoritative answer, and
non-authoritative data from the answer section of authoritative
answers,
+ Additional information from an authoritative answer,
Data from the authority section of a non-authoritative answer,
Additional information from non-authoritative answers.</code></pre>
<p>Note that the answer section of an authoritative answer normally contains only authoritative data. However when the name sought is an alias (see section 10.1.1) only the record describing that alias is necessarily authoritative. Clients should assume that other records may have come from the server’s cache. Where authoritative answers are required, the client should query again, using the canonical name associated with the alias.</p>
<p>Unauthenticated RRs received and cached from the least trustworthy of those groupings, that is data from the additional data section, and data from the authority section of a non-authoritative answer, should not be cached in such a way that they would ever be returned as answers to a received query. They may be returned as additional information where appropriate. Ignoring this would allow the trustworthiness of relatively untrustworthy data to be increased without cause or excuse.</p>
<p>When DNSSEC is in use, and an authenticated reply has been received and verified, the data thus authenticated shall be considered more trustworthy than unauthenticated data of the same type. Note that throughout this document, “authoritative” means a reply with the AA bit set. DNSSEC uses trusted chains of SIG and KEY records to determine the authenticity of data, the AA bit is almost irrelevant. However DNSSEC aware servers must still correctly set the AA bit in responses to enable correct operation with servers that are not security aware.</p>
<p>Note that, glue excluded, it is impossible for data from two correctly configured primary zone files, two correctly configured secondary zones (data from zone transfers) or data from correctly configured primary and secondary zones to ever conflict. Where glue for the same name exists in multiple zones, and differs in value, the nameserver should select data from a primary zone file in preference to secondary, but otherwise may choose any single set of such data. Choosing that which appears to come from a source nearer the authoritative data source may make sense where that can be determined. Choosing primary data over secondary allows the source of incorrect glue data to be discovered more readily, when a problem with such data exists. Where a server can detect from two zone files that one or more are incorrectly configured, so as to create conflicts, it should refuse to load the zones determined to be erroneous, and issue suitable diagnostics.</p>
<p>“Glue” above includes any record in a zone file that is not properly part of that zone, including nameserver records of delegated sub- zones (NS records), address records that accompany those NS records (A, AAAA, etc), and any other stray data that might appear.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.24.3" id="sending-rrsets"><span class="header-section-number">6.24.3</span> Sending RRSets</h3>
<p>A Resource Record Set should only be included once in any DNS reply. It may occur in any of the Answer, Authority, or Additional Information sections, as required. However it should not be repeated in the same, or any other, section, except where explicitly required by a specification. For example, an AXFR response requires the SOA record (always an RRSet containing a single RR) be both the first and last record of the reply. Where duplicates are required this way, the TTL transmitted in each case must be the same.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.25" id="canonical-form-and-order-of-resource-records"><span class="header-section-number">6.25</span> Canonical Form and Order of Resource Records</h2>
<p>This section defines a canonical form for resource records, a canonical ordering of DNS names, and a canonical ordering of resource records within an RRset. A canonical name order is required to construct the NSEC name chain. A canonical RR form and ordering within an RRset are required in order to construct and verify RRSIG RRs.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.25.1" id="canonical-dns-name-order"><span class="header-section-number">6.25.1</span> Canonical DNS Name Order</h3>
<p>For the purposes of DNS security, owner names are ordered by treating individual labels as unsigned left-justified octet strings. The absence of a octet sorts before a zero value octet, and uppercase US-ASCII letters are treated as if they were lowercase US-ASCII letters.</p>
<p>To compute the canonical ordering of a set of DNS names, start by sorting the names according to their most significant (rightmost) labels. For names in which the most significant label is identical, continue sorting according to their next most significant label, and so forth.</p>
<p>For example, the following names are sorted in canonical DNS name order. The most significant label is “example”. At this level, “example” sorts first, followed by names ending in “a.example”, then by names ending “z.example”. The names within each level are sorted in the same way.</p>
<pre><code>        example
        a.example
        yljkjljk.a.example
        Z.a.example
        zABC.a.EXAMPLE
        z.example
        \001.z.example
        *.z.example
        \200.z.example</code></pre>
<h3 data-number="6.25.2" id="canonical-rr-form"><span class="header-section-number">6.25.2</span> Canonical RR Form</h3>
<p>For the purposes of DNS security, the canonical form of an RR is the wire format of the RR where:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>every domain name in the RR is fully expanded (no DNS name compression) and fully qualified;</p></li>
<li><p>all uppercase US-ASCII letters in the owner name of the RR are replaced by the corresponding lowercase US-ASCII letters;</p></li>
<li><p>if the type of the RR is NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA, MB, MG, MR, PTR, HINFO, MINFO, MX, HINFO, RP, AFSDB, RT, SIG, PX, NXT, NAPTR, KX, SRV, DNAME, A6, RRSIG, or NSEC, all uppercase US-ASCII letters in the DNS names contained within the RDATA are replaced by the corresponding lowercase US-ASCII letters;</p></li>
<li><p>if the owner name of the RR is a wildcard name, the owner name is in its original unexpanded form, including the "*" label (no wildcard substitution); and</p></li>
<li><p>the RR’s TTL is set to its original value as it appears in the originating authoritative zone or the Original TTL field of the covering RRSIG RR.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 data-number="6.25.3" id="canonical-rr-ordering-within-an-rrset"><span class="header-section-number">6.25.3</span> Canonical RR Ordering within an RRSet</h3>
<p>For the purposes of DNS security, RRs with the same owner name, class, and type are sorted by treating the RDATA portion of the canonical form of each RR as a left-justified unsigned octet sequence in which the absence of an octet sorts before a zero octet.</p>
<p><a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2181.txt">RFC-2181</a> specifies that an RRset is not allowed to contain duplicate records (multiple RRs with the same owner name, class, type, and RDATA). Therefore, if an implementation detects duplicate RRs when putting the RRset in canonical form, it MUST treat this as a protocol error. If the implementation chooses to handle this protocol error in the spirit of the robustness principle (being liberal in what it accepts), it MUST remove all but one of the duplicate RR(s) for the purposes of calculating the canonical form of the RRset.</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="special-purpose-domains"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Special Purpose Domains</h1>
<h2 data-number="7.1" id="in-addr.arpa-domain"><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> IN-ADDR.ARPA Domain</h2>
<p>The Internet uses a special domain to support gateway location and Internet address to host mapping. Other classes may employ a similar strategy in other domains. The intent of this domain is to provide a guaranteed method to perform host address to host name mapping, and to facilitate queries to locate all gateways on a particular network in the Internet.</p>
<p>Note that both of these services are similar to functions that could be performed by inverse queries; the difference is that this part of the domain name space is structured according to address, and hence can guarantee that the appropriate data can be located without an exhaustive search of the domain space.</p>
<p>The domain begins at IN-ADDR.ARPA and has a substructure which follows the Internet addressing structure.</p>
<p>Domain names in the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain are defined to have up to four labels in addition to the IN-ADDR.ARPA suffix. Each label represents one octet of an Internet address, and is expressed as a character string for a decimal value in the range 0-255 (with leading zeros omitted except in the case of a zero octet which is represented by a single zero).</p>
<p>Host addresses are represented by domain names that have all four labels specified. Thus data for Internet address 10.2.0.52 is located at domain name 52.0.2.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA. The reversal, though awkward to read, allows zones to be delegated which are exactly one network of address space. For example, 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA can be a zone containing data for the ARPANET, while 26.IN-ADDR.ARPA can be a separate zone for MILNET. Address nodes are used to hold pointers to primary host names in the normal domain space.</p>
<p>Network numbers correspond to some non-terminal nodes at various depths in the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain, since Internet network numbers are either 1, 2, or 3 octets. Network nodes are used to hold pointers to the primary host names of gateways attached to that network. Since a gateway is, by definition, on more than one network, it will typically have two or more network nodes which point at it. Gateways will also have host level pointers at their fully qualified addresses.</p>
<p>Both the gateway pointers at network nodes and the normal host pointers at full address nodes use the PTR RR to point back to the primary domain names of the corresponding hosts.</p>
<p>For example, the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain will contain information about the ISI gateway between net 10 and 26, an MIT gateway from net 10 to MIT’s net 18, and A<nolink>.ISI.EDU and MULTICS<nolink>.MIT.EDU. Assuming that ISI gateway has addresses 10.2.0.22 and 26.0.0.103, and a name MILNET- GW<nolink>.ISI.EDU, and the MIT gateway has addresses 10.0.0.77 and 18.10.0.4 and a name GW<nolink>.LCS.MIT.EDU, the domain database would contain:</p>
<pre><code>10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU.
10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   GW.LCS.MIT.EDU.
18.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   GW.LCS.MIT.EDU.
26.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU.
22.0.2.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.     PTR   MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU.
103.0.0.26.IN-ADDR.ARPA.    PTR   MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU.

<p>Thus a program which wanted to locate gateways on net 10 would originate a query of the form QTYPE=PTR, QCLASS=IN, QNAME=10.IN-ADDR.ARPA. It would receive two RRs in response:</p>
<pre><code>10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU.
10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.            PTR   GW.LCS.MIT.EDU.</code></pre>
<p>The program could then originate QTYPE=A, QCLASS=IN queries for MILNET- GW<nolink>.ISI.EDU. and GW<nolink>.LCS.MIT.EDU. to discover the Internet addresses of these gateways.</p>
<p>A resolver which wanted to find the host name corresponding to Internet host address 10.0.0.6 would pursue a query of the form QTYPE=PTR, QCLASS=IN, QNAME=6.0.0.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA, and would receive:</p>
<pre><code>6.0.0.10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.      PTR   MULTICS.MIT.EDU.</code></pre>
<p>Several cautions apply to the use of these services: - Since the IN-ADDR.ARPA special domain and the normal domain for a particular host or gateway will be in different zones, the possibility exists that that the data may be inconsistent.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gateways will often have two names in separate domains, only one of which can be primary.</p></li>
<li><p>Systems that use the domain database to initialize their routing tables must start with enough gateway information to guarantee that they can access the appropriate name server.</p></li>
<li><p>The gateway data only reflects the existence of a gateway in a manner equivalent to the current HOSTS.TXT file. It doesn’t replace the dynamic availability information from GGP or EGP.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="ip6.arpa-domain"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> IP6.ARPA Domain</h2>
<p>The IP6.ARPA domain provides an analogous purpose to IN-ADDR.ARPA.</p>
<p>Previously, in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1886.txt">RFC-1886</a> the domain IP6.INT was established. However, this was deprecated in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3152.txt">RFC-3152</a> in favor of IP6.ARPA. They both serve the same purpose.</p>
<p>In this domain, a resolver which wanted to find the host name corresponding to Internet host address 4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab would pursue a query of the form QTYPE=PTR, QCLASS=IN, QNAME=b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.4.0.0.0.3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.ARPA., and would receive:</p>
<pre><code>b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.4.0.0.0.3.0.0.0.2.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.2.3.4.IP6.ARPA.  PTR   MULTICS.MIT.EDU.</code></pre>
<h1 data-number="8" id="master-files"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Master Files</h1>
<p>Master files are text files that contain RRs in text form. Since the contents of a zone can be expressed in the form of a list of RRs a master file is most often used to define a zone, though it can be used to list a cache’s contents. Hence, this section first discusses the format of RRs in a master file, and then the special considerations when a master file is used to create a zone in some name server.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.1" id="format"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Format</h2>
<p>The format of these files is a sequence of entries. Entries are predominantly line-oriented, though parentheses can be used to continue a list of items across a line boundary, and text literals can contain CRLF within the text. Any combination of tabs and spaces act as a delimiter between the separate items that make up an entry. The end of any line in the master file can end with a comment. The comment starts with a “;” (semicolon).</p>
<p>The following entries are defined:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;blank&gt;[&lt;comment&gt;]

$ORIGIN &lt;domain-name&gt; [&lt;comment&gt;]

$INCLUDE &lt;file-name&gt; [&lt;domain-name&gt;] [&lt;comment&gt;]

&lt;domain-name&gt;&lt;rr&gt; [&lt;comment&gt;]

&lt;blank&gt;&lt;rr&gt; [&lt;comment&gt;]</code></pre>
<p>Blank lines, with or without comments, are allowed anywhere in the file.</p>
<p>Two control entries are defined: $ORIGIN and $INCLUDE. $ORIGIN is followed by a domain name, and resets the current origin for relative domain names to the stated name. $INCLUDE inserts the named file into the current file, and may optionally specify a domain name that sets the relative domain name origin for the included file. $INCLUDE may also have a comment. Note that a $INCLUDE entry never changes the relative origin of the parent file, regardless of changes to the relative origin made within the included file.</p>
<p>The last two forms represent RRs. If an entry for an RR begins with a blank, then the RR is assumed to be owned by the last stated owner. If an RR entry begins with a &lt;domain-name&gt;, then the owner name is reset.</p>
<p>&lt;rr&gt; contents take one of the following forms:</p>
<pre><code>[&lt;TTL&gt;] [&lt;class&gt;] &lt;type&gt; &lt;RDATA&gt;

[&lt;class&gt;] [&lt;TTL&gt;] &lt;type&gt; &lt;RDATA&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The RR begins with optional TTL and class fields, followed by a type and RDATA field appropriate to the type and class. Class and type use the standard mnemonics, TTL is a decimal integer. Omitted class and TTL values are default to the last explicitly stated values. Since type and class mnemonics are disjoint, the parse is unique. (Note that this order is different from the order used in examples and the order used in the actual RRs; the given order allows easier parsing and defaulting.)</p>
<p>&lt;domain-name&gt;s make up a large share of the data in the master file. The labels in the domain name are expressed as character strings and separated by dots. Quoting conventions allow arbitrary characters to be stored in domain names. Domain names that end in a dot are called absolute, and are taken as complete. Domain names which do not end in a dot are called relative; the actual domain name is the concatenation of the relative part with an origin specified in a $ORIGIN, $INCLUDE, or as an argument to the master file loading routine. A relative name is an error when no origin is available.</p>
<p>&lt;character-string&gt; is expressed in one or two ways: as a contiguous set of characters without interior spaces, or as a string beginning with a " and ending with a “. Inside a” delimited string any character can occur, except for a " itself, which must be quoted using \ (back slash).</p>
<p>Because these files are text files several special encodings are necessary to allow arbitrary data to be loaded. In particular:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 42%" />
<col style="width: 57%" />

<td>A free standing @ is used to denote the current origin</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>Where X is any character other than a digit (0-9), is used to quote that character so that its special meaning does not apply. For example, “\.” can be used to place a dot character in a label</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>\DDD</td>
<td>Where each D is a digit is the octet corresponding to the decimal number described by DDD. The resulting octet is assumed to be text and is not checked for special meaning</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>( )</td>
<td>Parentheses are used to group data that crosses a line boundary. In effect, line terminations are not recognized within parentheses</td>

<h2 data-number="8.2" id="use-of-master-files-to-define-zones"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Use of master files to define zones</h2>
<p>When a master file is used to load a zone, the operation should be suppressed if any errors are encountered in the master file. The rationale for this is that a single error can have widespread consequences. For example, suppose that the RRs defining a delegation have syntax errors; then the server will return authoritative name errors for all names in the subzone (except in the case where the subzone is also present on the server).</p>
<p>Several other validity checks that should be performed in addition to insuring that the file is syntactically correct:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>All RRs in the file should have the same class.</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly one SOA RR should be present at the top of the zone.</p></li>
<li><p>If delegations are present and glue information is required, it should be present.</p></li>
<li><p>Information present outside of the authoritative nodes in the zone should be glue information, rather than the result of an origin or similar error.</p></li>

<h1 data-number="9" id="edns0"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> EDNS(<code>0</code>)</h1>
<p>The Domain Name System’s wire protocol includes a number of fixed fields whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not allow requestors to advertise their capabilities to responders. In response to this, the backward-compatible Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(<code>0</code>)) have been created to allow the protocol to grow.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="introduction-1"><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>DNS <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a> specifies a message format, and within such messages there are standard formats for encoding options, errors, and name compression. The maximum allowable size of a DNS message over UDP not using EDNS is 512 bytes. Many of DNS’s protocol limits, such as the maximum message size over UDP, are too small to efficiently support the additional information that can be conveyed in the DNS (e.g., several IPv6 addresses or DNS Security (DNSSEC) signatures). Finally, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a> does not define any way for implementations to advertise their capabilities to any of the other actors they interact with.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2671.txt">RFC-2671</a> added extension mechanisms to DNS. These mechanisms are widely supported, and a number of new DNS uses and protocol extensions depend on the presence of these extensions. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6891.txt">RFC-6891</a> refined and obsoleted <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2671.txt">RFC-2671</a>.</p>
<p>Unextended agents will not know how to interpret the protocol extensions. Extended agents need to be prepared for handling the interactions with unextended clients in the face of new protocol elements and fall back gracefully to unextended DNS.</p>
<p>EDNS is a hop-by-hop extension to DNS. This means the use of EDNS is negotiated between each pair of hosts in a DNS resolution process, for instance, the stub resolver communicating with the recursive resolver or the recursive resolver communicating with an authoritative server.</p>
<p>EDNS provides a mechanism to improve the scalability of DNS as its uses get more diverse on the Internet. It does this by enabling the use of UDP transport for DNS messages with sizes beyond the 512 limit specified in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC-1035</a> as well as providing extra data space for additional flags and return codes (RCODEs). However, implementation experience indicates that adding new RCODEs should be avoided due to the difficulty in upgrading the installed base. Flags SHOULD be used only when necessary for DNS resolution to function.</p>
<p>For many uses, an EDNS Option Code may be preferred.</p>
<p>Over time, some applications of DNS have made EDNS a requirement for their deployment. For instance, DNSSEC uses the additional flag space introduced in EDNS to signal the request to include DNSSEC data in a DNS response.</p>
<p>Given the increase in DNS response sizes when including larger data items such as AAAA records, DNSSEC information (e.g., RRSIG or DNSKEY), or large TXT records, the additional UDP payload capabilities provided by EDNS can help improve the scalability of the DNS by avoiding widespread use of TCP for DNS transport.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.2" id="dns-message-changes"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> DNS Message Changes</h2>
<h3 data-number="9.2.1" id="message-header"><span class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Message Header</h3>
<p>The DNS message header’s second full 16-bit word is divided into a 4-bit OPCODE, a 4-bit RCODE, and a number of 1-bit flags (see <a href="#header-format">Header Format</a>). Some of these flag values were marked for future use, and most of these have since been allocated. Also, most of the RCODE values are now in use. The OPT pseudo-RR specified below contains extensions to the RCODE bit field as well as additional flag bits.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.2" id="udp-message-size"><span class="header-section-number">9.2.2</span> UDP Message Size</h3>
<p>Traditional DNS messages are limited to 512 octets in size when sent over UDP (see <a href="#size-limits">Size Limits</a>). Fitting the increasing amounts of data that can be transported in DNS in this 512-byte limit is becoming more difficult. For instance, inclusion of DNSSEC records frequently requires a much larger response than a 512-byte message can hold.</p>
<p>EDNS(<code>0</code>) specifies a way to advertise additional features such as larger response size capability, which is intended to help avoid truncated UDP responses, which in turn cause retry over TCP. It therefore provides support for transporting these larger packet sizes without needing to resort to TCP for transport.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.2.3" id="the-opt-psuedo-rr"><span class="header-section-number">9.2.3</span> The OPT Psuedo-RR</h3>
<p>The main change in EDNS(<code>0</code>) is the addition of the OPT “psuedo”-RR. This addition is detailed in <a href="#rr-type-41---opt">RR TYPE 41 - OPT</a>.</p>
<h1 data-number="10" id="dnssec"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> DNSSEC</h1>
<p>Historically, there has been no way to validate the data retrieved from the DNS, or ensure server to server communications are not tampered on the wire. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add data origin authentication and data integrity to the Domain Name System. This section intoduces these extensions and describes their capabilities and limitations. This section also discusses the services that the DNS security extensions do and do not provide. Last, this section describes the interrelationships between the documents that collectively describe DNSSEC.</p>
<p>Three RFCs form the current definition of DNSSEC as it is today. These RFCs are <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4033.txt">RFC-4033</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4034.txt">RFC-4034</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4035.txt">RFC-4035</a>. These documents update, clarify, and refine the security extensions defined in previous RFCs. These security extensions consist of a set of new resource record types and modifications to the existing DNS protocol.</p>
<p>The DNS security extensions provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data, as well as a means of public key distribution. These extensions do not provide confidentiality.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.1.1" id="definitions-of-important-dnssec-terms"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.1</span> Definitions of Important DNSSEC Terms</h3>
<p>This section servers as a glossary of important DNSSEC terms. This is intended to be useful as a reference, first time readers may wish to skim this section quickly, read the rest of the DNSSEC sections, and then come back to this section.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication Chain</strong>: An alternating sequence of DNS public key (DNSKEY) RRsets and Delegation Signer (DS) RRsets forms a chain of signed data, with each link in the chain vouching for the next. A DNSKEY RR is used to verify the signature covering a DS RR and allows the DS RR to be authenticated. The DS RR contains a hash of another DNSKEY RR and this new DNSKEY RR is authenticated by matching the hash in the DS RR. This new DNSKEY RR in turn authenticates another DNSKEY RRset and, in turn, some DNSKEY RR in this set may be used to authenticate another DS RR, and so forth until the chain finally ends with a DNSKEY RR whose corresponding private key signs the desired DNS data. For example, the root DNSKEY RRset can be used to authenticate the DS RRset for “example.” The “example.” DS RRset contains a hash that matches some “example.” DNSKEY, and this DNSKEY’s corresponding private key signs the “example.” DNSKEY RRset. Private key counterparts of the “example.” DNSKEY RRset sign data records such as “www.example.” and DS RRs for delegations such as “subzone.example.”</p>
<p><strong>Authentication Key</strong>: A public key that a security-aware resolver has verified and can therefore use to authenticate data. A security-aware resolver can obtain authentication keys in three ways. First, the resolver is generally configured to know about at least one public key; this configured data is usually either the public key itself or a hash of the public key as found in the DS RR (see “trust anchor”). Second, the resolver may use an authenticated public key to verify a DS RR and the DNSKEY RR to which the DS RR refers. Third, the resolver may be able to determine that a new public key has been signed by the private key corresponding to another public key that the resolver has verified. Note that the resolver must always be guided by local policy when deciding whether to authenticate a new public key, even if the local policy is simply to authenticate any new public key for which the resolver is able verify the signature.</p>
<p><strong>Authoritative RRset</strong>: Within the context of a particular zone, an RRset is “authoritative” if and only if the owner name of the RRset lies within the subset of the name space that is at or below the zone apex and at or above the cuts that separate the zone from its children, if any. All RRsets at the zone apex are authoritative, except for certain RRsets at this domain name that, if present, belong to this zone’s parent. These RRset could include a DS RRset, the NSEC RRset referencing this DS RRset (the “parental NSEC”), and RRSIG RRs associated with these RRsets, all of which are authoritative in the parent zone. Similarly, if this zone contains any delegation points, only the parental NSEC RRset, DS RRsets, and any RRSIG RRs associated with these RRsets are authoritative for this zone.</p>
<p><strong>Delegation Point</strong>: Term used to describe the name at the parental side of a zone cut. That is, the delegation point for “foo.example” would be the foo.example node in the “example” zone (as opposed to the zone apex of the “foo.example” zone). See also zone apex.</p>
<p><strong>Island of Security</strong>: Term used to describe a signed, delegated zone that does not have an authentication chain from its delegating parent. That is, there is no DS RR containing a hash of a DNSKEY RR for the island in its delegating parent zone. An island of security is served by security-aware name servers and may provide authentication chains to any delegated child zones. Responses from an island of security or its descendents can only be authenticated if its authentication keys can be authenticated by some trusted means out of band from the DNS protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Key Signing Key (KSK)</strong>: An authentication key that corresponds to a private key used to sign one or more other authentication keys for a given zone. Typically, the private key corresponding to a key signing key will sign a zone signing key, which in turn has a corresponding private key that will sign other zone data. Local policy may require that the zone signing key be changed frequently, while the key signing key may have a longer validity period in order to provide a more stable secure entry point into the zone. Designating an authentication key as a key signing key is purely an operational issue: DNSSEC validation does not distinguish between key signing keys and other DNSSEC authentication keys, and it is possible to use a single key as both a key signing key and a zone signing key. Key signing keys are discussed in more detail in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3757.txt">RFC-3757</a>. Also see zone signing key.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Validating Security-Aware Stub Resolver</strong>: A security-aware stub resolver that trusts one or more security-aware recursive name servers to perform most of the tasks discussed in this document set on its behalf. In particular, a non-validating security-aware stub resolver is an entity that sends DNS queries, receives DNS responses, and is capable of establishing an appropriately secured channel to a security-aware recursive name server that will provide these services on behalf of the security-aware stub resolver. See also security-aware stub resolver, validating security-aware stub resolver.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Validating Stub Resolver</strong>: A less tedious term for a non-validating security-aware stub resolver.</p>
<p><strong>Security-Aware Name Server</strong>: An entity acting in the role of a name server that understands the DNS security extensions defined in this document set. In particular, a security-aware name server is an entity that receives DNS queries, sends DNS responses, supports the EDNS(<code>0</code>) message size extension and the DO bit, and supports the RR types and message header bits defined in this document set.</p>
<p><strong>Security-Aware Recursive Name Server</strong>: An entity that acts in both the security-aware name server and security-aware resolver roles. A more cumbersome but equivalent phrase would be “a security-aware name server that offers recursive service”.</p>
<p><strong>Security-Aware Resolver</strong>: An entity acting in the role of a resolver that understands the DNS security extensions defined in this document set. In particular, a security-aware resolver is an entity that sends DNS queries, receives DNS responses, supports the EDNS(<code>0</code>) message size extension and the DO bit, and is capable of using the RR types and message header bits defined in this document set to provide DNSSEC services.</p>
<p><strong>Security-Aware Stub Resolver</strong>: An entity acting in the role of a stub resolver that has enough of an understanding the DNS security extensions defined in this document set to provide additional services not available from a security-oblivious stub resolver. Security-aware stub resolvers may be either “validating” or “non-validating”, depending on whether the stub resolver attempts to verify DNSSEC signatures on its own or trusts a friendly security-aware name server to do so. See also validating stub resolver, non-validating stub resolver.</p>
<p><strong>Security-Oblivious &lt;anything&gt;</strong>: An &lt;anything&gt; that is not “security-aware”.</p>
<p><strong>Signed Zone</strong>: A zone whose RRsets are signed and that contains properly constructed DNSKEY, Resource Record Signature (RRSIG), Next Secure (NSEC), and (optionally) DS records.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Anchor</strong>: A configured DNSKEY RR or DS RR hash of a DNSKEY RR. A validating security-aware resolver uses this public key or hash as a starting point for building the authentication chain to a signed DNS response. In general, a validating resolver will have to obtain the initial values of its trust anchors via some secure or trusted means outside the DNS protocol. Presence of a trust anchor also implies that the resolver should expect the zone to which the trust anchor points to be signed.</p>
<p><strong>Unsigned Zone</strong>: A zone that is not signed.</p>
<p><strong>Validating Security-Aware Stub Resolver</strong>: A security-aware resolver that sends queries in recursive mode but that performs signature validation on its own rather than just blindly trusting an upstream security-aware recursive name server. See also security-aware stub resolver, non-validating security-aware stub resolver.</p>
<p><strong>Validating Stub Resolver</strong>: A less tedious term for a validating security-aware stub resolver.</p>
<p><strong>Zone Apex</strong>: Term used to describe the name at the child’s side of a zone cut. See also delegation point.</p>
<p><strong>Zone Signing Key (ZSK)</strong>: An authentication key that corresponds to a private key used to sign a zone. Typically, a zone signing key will be part of the same DNSKEY RRset as the key signing key whose corresponding private key signs this DNSKEY RRset, but the zone signing key is used for a slightly different purpose and may differ from the key signing key in other ways, such as validity lifetime. Designating an authentication key as a zone signing key is purely an operational issue; DNSSEC validation does not distinguish between zone signing keys and other DNSSEC authentication keys, and it is possible to use a single key as both a key signing key and a zone signing key. See also key signing key.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.2" id="services-provided-by-dnssec"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.2</span> Services Provided by DNSSEC</h3>
<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) security extensions provide origin authentication and integrity assurance services for DNS data, including mechanisms for authenticated denial of existence of DNS data. These mechanisms are described below.</p>
<p>These mechanisms require changes to the DNS protocol. DNSSEC adds four new resource record types: Resource Record Signature (RRSIG), DNS Public Key (DNSKEY), Delegation Signer (DS), and Next Secure (NSEC). It also adds two new message header bits: Checking Disabled (CD) and Authenticated Data (AD). In order to support the larger DNS message sizes that result from adding the DNSSEC RRs, DNSSEC also requires <a href="#edns0">EDNS(<code>0</code>)</a> support. Finally, DNSSEC requires support for the DNSSEC OK (DO) EDNS header bit (see <a href="#opt-record-ttl-field-use">OPT Record TTL Field Use</a> for its location) so that a security-aware resolver can indicate in its queries that it wishes to receive DNSSEC RRs in response messages.</p>
<p>Please see [x.x.x] for a discussion of the limitations of these extensions.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.1.2.1" id="data-origin-authentication-and-data-integrity"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.2.1</span> Data Origin Authentication and Data Integrity</h4>
<p>DNSSEC provides authentication by associating cryptographically generated digital signatures with DNS RRsets. These digital signatures are stored in a new resource record, the RRSIG record. Typically, there will be a single private key that signs a zone’s data, but multiple keys are possible. For example, there may be keys for each of several different digital signature algorithms. If a security-aware resolver reliably learns a zone’s public key, it can authenticate that zone’s signed data. An important DNSSEC concept is that the key that signs a zone’s data is associated with the zone itself and not with the zone’s authoritative name servers. (Public keys for DNS transaction authentication mechanisms may also appear in zones, as described in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2931.txt">RFC-2931</a>, but DNSSEC itself is concerned with object security of DNS data, not channel security of DNS transactions. The keys associated with transaction security may be stored in different RR types. See <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3755.txt">RFC-3755</a> for details.)</p>
<p>A security-aware resolver can learn a zone’s public key either by having a trust anchor configured into the resolver or by normal DNS resolution. To allow the latter, public keys are stored in a new type of resource record, the DNSKEY RR. Note that the private keys used to sign zone data must be kept secure and should be stored offline when practical. To discover a public key reliably via DNS resolution, the target key itself has to be signed by either a configured authentication key or another key that has been authenticated previously. Security-aware resolvers authenticate zone information by forming an authentication chain from a newly learned public key back to a previously known authentication public key, which in turn either has been configured into the resolver or must have been learned and verified previously. Therefore, the resolver must be configured with at least one trust anchor.</p>
<p>If the configured trust anchor is a zone signing key, then it will authenticate the associated zone; if the configured key is a key signing key, it will authenticate a zone signing key. If the configured trust anchor is the hash of a key rather than the key itself, the resolver may have to obtain the key via a DNS query. To help security-aware resolvers establish this authentication chain, security-aware name servers attempt to send the signature(s) needed to authenticate a zone’s public key(s) in the DNS reply message along with the public key itself, provided that there is space available in the message.</p>
<p>The Delegation Signer (DS) RR type simplifies some of the administrative tasks involved in signing delegations across organizational boundaries. The DS RRset resides at a delegation point in a parent zone and indicates the public key(s) corresponding to the private key(s) used to self-sign the DNSKEY RRset at the delegated child zone’s apex. The administrator of the child zone, in turn, uses the private key(s) corresponding to one or more of the public keys in this DNSKEY RRset to sign the child zone’s data. The typical authentication chain is therefore DNSKEY-&gt;[DS-&gt;DNSKEY]*-&gt;RRset, where “*” denotes zero or more DS-&gt;DNSKEY subchains. DNSSEC permits more complex authentication chains, such as additional layers of DNSKEY RRs signing other DNSKEY RRs within a zone.</p>
<p>A security-aware resolver normally constructs this authentication chain from the root of the DNS hierarchy down to the leaf zones based on configured knowledge of the public key for the root. Local policy, however, may also allow a security-aware resolver to use one or more configured public keys (or hashes of public keys) other than the root public key, may not provide configured knowledge of the root public key, or may prevent the resolver from using particular public keys for arbitrary reasons, even if those public keys are properly signed with verifiable signatures. DNSSEC provides mechanisms by which a security-aware resolver can determine whether an RRset’s signature is “valid” within the meaning of DNSSEC. In the final analysis, however, authenticating both DNS keys and data is a matter of local policy, which may extend or even override the protocol extensions defined in this document set. See [x.x.x] for further discussion.</p>

<p>The security mechanism described in <a href="#data-origin-authentication-and-data-integrity">Data Origin Authentication and Data Integrity</a> only provides a way to sign existing RRsets in a zone. The problem of providing negative responses with the same level of authentication and integrity requires the use of another new resource record type, the NSEC record. The NSEC record allows a security-aware resolver to authenticate a negative reply for either name or type non-existence with the same mechanisms used to authenticate other DNS replies. Use of NSEC records requires a canonical representation and ordering for domain names in zones. Chains of NSEC records explicitly describe the gaps, or “empty space”, between domain names in a zone and list the types of RRsets present at existing names. Each NSEC record is signed and authenticated using the mechanisms described in <a href="#data-origin-authentication-and-data-integrity">Data Origin Authentication and Data Integrity</a>.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.3" id="services-not-provided-by-dnssec"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.3</span> Services Not Provided by DNSSEC</h3>
<p>DNS was originally designed with the assumptions that the DNS will return the same answer to any given query regardless of who may have issued the query (in practice this does not hold up, a nameserver might choose to include random A glue records in order to perform load balancing for example), and that all data in the DNS is thus visible. Accordingly, DNSSEC is not designed to provide confidentiality, access control lists, or other means of differentiating between inquirers.</p>
<p>DNSSEC provides no protection against denial of service attacks. Security-aware resolvers and security-aware name servers are vulnerable to an additional class of denial of service attacks based on cryptographic operations. Please see [x.x.x] for details.</p>
<p>The DNS security extensions provide data and origin authentication for DNS data. The mechanisms outlined above are not designed to protect operations such as zone transfers and dynamic update. Message authentication schemes described in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2845.txt">RFC-2845</a> and <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2931.txt">RFC-2931</a> address security operations that pertain to these transactions.</p>

<p>The specification in the DNSSEC document set defines the behavior for zone signers and security-aware name servers and resolvers in such a way that the validating entities can unambiguously determine the state of the data.</p>
<p>A validating resolver can determine the following 4 states:</p>
<p><strong>Secure</strong>: The validating resolver has a trust anchor, has a chain of trust, and is able to verify all the signatures in the response.</p>
<p><strong>Insecure</strong>: The validating resolver has a trust anchor, a chain of trust, and, at some delegation point, signed proof of the non-existence of a DS record. This indicates that subsequent branches in the tree are provably insecure. A validating resolver may have a local policy to mark parts of the domain space as insecure.</p>
<p><strong>Bogus</strong>: The validating resolver has a trust anchor and a secure delegation indicating that subsidiary data is signed, but the response fails to validate for some reason: missing signatures, expired signatures, signatures with unsupported algorithms, data missing that the relevant NSEC RR says should be present, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Indeterminate</strong>: There is no trust anchor that would indicate that a specific portion of the tree is secure. This is the default operation mode.</p>
<p>This specification only defines how security-aware name servers can signal non-validating stub resolvers that data was found to be bogus (using RCODE=2, “Server Failure”; see [x.x.x]).</p>
<p>There is a mechanism for security-aware name servers to signal security-aware stub resolvers that data was found to be secure (using the AD bit; see [x.x.x]).</p>
<p>This specification does not define a format for communicating why responses were found to be bogus or marked as insecure. The current signaling mechanism does not distinguish between indeterminate and insecure states.</p>
<p>A method for signaling advanced error codes and policy between a security-aware stub resolver and security-aware recursive nameservers is a topic for future work, as is the interface between a security- aware resolver and the applications that use it. Note, however, that the lack of the specification of such communication does not prohibit deployment of signed zones or the deployment of security aware recursive name servers that prohibit propagation of bogus data to the applications.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.5" id="resolver-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.5</span> Resolver Considerations</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver has to be able to perform cryptographic functions necessary to verify digital signatures using at least the mandatory-to-implement algorithm(s). Security-aware resolvers must also be capable of forming an authentication chain from a newly learned zone back to an authentication key, as described above. This process might require additional queries to intermediate DNS zones to obtain necessary DNSKEY, DS, and RRSIG records. A security-aware resolver should be configured with at least one trust anchor as the starting point from which it will attempt to establish authentication chains.</p>
<p>If a security-aware resolver is separated from the relevant authoritative name servers by a recursive name server or by any sort of intermediary device that acts as a proxy for DNS, and if the recursive name server or intermediary device is not security-aware, the security-aware resolver may not be capable of operating in a secure mode. For example, if a security-aware resolver’s packets are routed through a network address translation (NAT) device that includes a DNS proxy that is not security-aware, the security-aware resolver may find it difficult or impossible to obtain or validate signed DNS data. The security-aware resolver may have a particularly difficult time obtaining DS RRs in such a case, as DS RRs do not follow the usual DNS rules for ownership of RRs at zone cuts. Note that this problem is not specific to NATs: any security-oblivious DNS software of any kind between the security-aware resolver and the authoritative name servers will interfere with DNSSEC.</p>
<p>If a security-aware resolver must rely on an unsigned zone or a name server that is not security aware, the resolver may not be able to validate DNS responses and will need a local policy on whether to accept unverified responses.</p>
<p>A security-aware resolver should take a signature’s validation period into consideration when determining the TTL of data in its cache, to avoid caching signed data beyond the validity period of the signature. However, it should also allow for the possibility that the security-aware resolver’s own clock is wrong. Thus, a security-aware resolver that is part of a security-aware recursive name server will have to pay careful attention to the DNSSEC “checking disabled” (CD) bit (see [x.x.x]). This is in order to avoid blocking valid signatures from getting through to other security-aware resolvers that are clients of this recursive name server. See [x.x.x] for how a secure recursive server handles queries with the CD bit set.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.6" id="stub-resolver-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.6</span> Stub Resolver Considerations</h3>
<p>Although not strictly required to do so by the protocol, most DNS queries originate from stub resolvers. Stub resolvers, by definition, are minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server. Given the widespread use of stub resolvers, the DNSSEC architecture has to take stub resolvers into account, but the security features needed in a stub resolver differ in some respects from those needed in a security-aware iterative resolver.</p>
<p>Even a security-oblivious stub resolver may benefit from DNSSEC if the recursive name servers it uses are security-aware, but for the stub resolver to place any real reliance on DNSSEC services, the stub resolver must trust both the recursive name servers in question and the communication channels between itself and those name servers. The first of these issues is a local policy issue: in essence, a security-oblivious stub resolver has no choice but to place itself at the mercy of the recursive name servers that it uses, as it does not perform DNSSEC validity checks on its own. The second issue requires some kind of channel security mechanism; proper use of DNS transaction authentication mechanisms such as SIG(<code>0</code>) (<a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2931.txt">RFC-2931</a>) or TSIG (<a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2845.txt">RFC-2845</a>) would suffice, as would appropriate use of IPsec. Particular implementations may have other choices available, such as operating system specific interprocess communication mechanisms. Confidentiality is not needed for this channel, but data integrity and message authentication are.</p>
<p>A security-aware stub resolver that does trust both its recursive name servers and its communication channel to them may choose to examine the setting of the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the message header of the response messages it receives. The stub resolver can use this flag bit as a hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response.</p>
<p>There is one more step that a security-aware stub resolver can take if, for whatever reason, it is not able to establish a useful trust relationship with the recursive name servers that it uses: it can perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages. A validating stub resolver is thus able to treat the DNSSEC signatures as trust relationships between the zone administrators and the stub resolver itself.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.7" id="zone-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.7</span> Zone Considerations</h3>
<p>There are several differences between signed and unsigned zones. A signed zone will contain additional security-related records (RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS, and NSEC records). RRSIG and NSEC records may be generated by a signing process prior to serving the zone. The RRSIG records that accompany zone data have defined inception and expiration times that establish a validity period for the signatures and the zone data the signatures cover.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.1.7.1" id="ttl-values-vs.-rrsig-validity-period"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.7.1</span> TTL Values vs. RRSIG Validity Period</h4>
<p>It is important to note the distinction between a RRset’s TTL value and the signature validity period specified by the RRSIG RR covering that RRset. DNSSEC does not change the definition or function of the TTL value, which is intended to maintain database coherency in caches. A caching resolver purges RRsets from its cache no later than the end of the time period specified by the TTL fields of those RRsets, regardless of whether the resolver is security-aware.</p>
<p>The inception and expiration fields in the RRSIG RR (see [x.x.x]), on the other hand, specify the time period during which the signature can be used to validate the covered RRset. The signatures associated with signed zone data are only valid for the time period specified by these fields in the RRSIG RRs in question. TTL values cannot extend the validity period of signed RRsets in a resolver’s cache, but the resolver may use the time remaining before expiration of the signature validity period of a signed RRset as an upper bound for the TTL of the signed RRset and its associated RRSIG RR in the resolver’s cache.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.1.7.2" id="temporal-dependency-issues-for-zones"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.7.2</span> Temporal Dependency Issues for Zones</h4>
<p>A signed zone requires regular maintenance to ensure that each RRset in the zone has a current valid RRSIG RR. The signature validity period of an RRSIG RR is an interval during which the signature for one particular signed RRset can be considered valid, and the signatures of different RRsets in a zone may expire at different times. Re-signing one or more RRsets in a zone will change one or more RRSIG RRs, which will in turn require incrementing the zone’s SOA serial number to indicate that a zone change has occurred and re-signing the SOA RRset itself. Thus, re-signing any RRset in a zone may also trigger DNS NOTIFY messages and zone transfer operations.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.8" id="name-server-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.8</span> Name Server Considerations</h3>
<p>A security-aware name server should include the appropriate DNSSEC records (RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS, and NSEC) in all responses to queries from resolvers that have signaled their willingness to receive such records via use of the DO bit in the EDNS header, subject to message size limitations. Because inclusion of these DNSSEC RRs could easily cause UDP message truncation and fallback to TCP, a security-aware name server must also support the EDNS “sender’s UDP payload” mechanism.</p>
<p>If possible, the private half of each DNSSEC key pair should be kept offline, but this will not be possible for a zone for which DNS dynamic update has been enabled. In the dynamic update case, the primary master server for the zone will have to re-sign the zone when it is updated, so the private key corresponding to the zone signing key will have to be kept online. This is an example of a situation in which the ability to separate the zone’s DNSKEY RRset into zone signing key(s) and key signing key(s) may be useful, as the key signing key(s) in such a case can still be kept offline and may have a longer useful lifetime than the zone signing key(s).</p>
<p>By itself, DNSSEC is not enough to protect the integrity of an entire zone during zone transfer operations, as even a signed zone contains some unsigned, nonauthoritative data if the zone has any children. Therefore, zone maintenance operations will require some additional mechanisms (most likely some form of channel security, such as TSIG, SIG(<code>0</code>), or IPsec).</p>
<h3 data-number="10.1.9" id="security-considerations-1"><span class="header-section-number">10.1.9</span> Security Considerations</h3>
<p>This document introduces DNS security extensions and describes the document set that contains the new security records and DNS protocol modifications. The extensions provide data origin authentication and data integrity using digital signatures over resource record sets. This section discusses the limitations of these extensions.</p>
<p>In order for a security-aware resolver to validate a DNS response, all zones along the path from the trusted starting point to the zone containing the response zones must be signed, and all name servers and resolvers involved in the resolution process must be security-aware, as defined in this document set. A security-aware resolver cannot verify responses originating from an unsigned zone, from a zone not served by a security-aware name server, or for any DNS data that the resolver is only able to obtain through a recursive name server that is not security-aware. If there is a break in the authentication chain such that a security-aware resolver cannot obtain and validate the authentication keys it needs, then the security-aware resolver cannot validate the affected DNS data.</p>
<p>This document briefly discusses other methods of adding security to a DNS query, such as using a channel secured by IPsec or using a DNS transaction authentication mechanism such as TSIG (<a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2845.txt">RFC-2845</a>) or SIG(<code>0</code>) (<a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2931.txt">RFC-2931</a>), but transaction security is not part of DNSSEC per se.</p>
<p>A non-validating security-aware stub resolver, by definition, does not perform DNSSEC signature validation on its own and thus is vulnerable both to attacks on (and by) the security-aware recursive name servers that perform these checks on its behalf and to attacks on its communication with those security-aware recursive name servers. Non-validating security-aware stub resolvers should use some form of channel security to defend against the latter threat. The only known defense against the former threat would be for the security-aware stub resolver to perform its own signature validation, at which point, again by definition, it would no longer be a non-validating security-aware stub resolver.</p>
<p>DNSSEC does not protect against denial of service attacks. DNSSEC makes DNS vulnerable to a new class of denial of service attacks based on cryptographic operations against security-aware resolvers and security-aware name servers, as an attacker can attempt to use DNSSEC mechanisms to consume a victim’s resources. This class of attacks takes at least two forms. An attacker may be able to consume resources in a security-aware resolver’s signature validation code by tampering with RRSIG RRs in response messages or by constructing needlessly complex signature chains. An attacker may also be able to consume resources in a security-aware name server that supports DNS dynamic update, by sending a stream of update messages that force the security-aware name server to re-sign some RRsets in the zone more frequently than would otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p>Due to a deliberate design choice, DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality.</p>
<p>DNSSEC introduces the ability for a hostile party to enumerate all the names in a zone by following the NSEC chain. NSEC RRs assert which names do not exist in a zone by linking from existing name to existing name along a canonical ordering of all the names within a zone. Thus, an attacker can query these NSEC RRs in sequence to obtain all the names in a zone. Although this is not an attack on the DNS itself, it could allow an attacker to map network hosts or other resources by enumerating the contents of a zone.</p>
<p>DNSSEC introduces significant additional complexity to the DNS and thus introduces many new opportunities for implementation bugs and misconfigured zones. In particular, enabling DNSSEC signature validation in a resolver may cause entire legitimate zones to become effectively unreachable due to DNSSEC configuration errors or bugs.</p>
<p>DNSSEC does not protect against tampering with unsigned zone data. Non-authoritative data at zone cuts (glue and NS RRs in the parent zone) are not signed. This does not pose a problem when validating the authentication chain, but it does mean that the non-authoritative data itself is vulnerable to tampering during zone transfer operations. Thus, while DNSSEC can provide data origin authentication and data integrity for RRsets, it cannot do so for zones, and other mechanisms (such as TSIG, SIG(<code>0</code>), or IPsec) must be used to protect zone transfer operations.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.2" id="dnssec-algorithm-and-digest-types"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> DNSSEC Algorithm and Digest Types</h2>
<p>The DNS security extensions are designed to be independent of the underlying cryptographic algorithms. The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS resource records all use a DNSSEC Algorithm Number to identify the cryptographic algorithm in use by the resource record. The DS resource record also specifies a Digest Algorithm Number to identify the digest algorithm used to construct the DS record. The currently defined Algorithm and Digest Types are listed below. Additional Algorithm or Digest Types could be added as advances in cryptography warrant them.</p>
<p>A DNSSEC aware resolver or name server MUST implement all MANDATORY algorithms.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.2.1" id="dnssec-algorithm-types"><span class="header-section-number">10.2.1</span> DNSSEC Algorithm Types</h3>
<p>The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs use an 8-bit number to identify the security algorithm being used. These values are stored in the “Algorithm number” field in the resource record RDATA.</p>
<p>Some algorithms are usable only for zone signing (DNSSEC), some only for transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG), and some for both. Those usable for zone signing may appear in DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs. Those usable for transaction security would be present in SIG(0) and KEY RRs, as described in <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2931.txt">RFC-2931</a>.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.3" id="key-tag-calculation"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Key Tag Calculation</h2>
<p>The Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS resource record types provides a mechanism for selecting a public key efficiently. In most cases, a combination of owner name, algorithm, and key tag can efficiently identify a DNSKEY record. Both the RRSIG and DS resource records have corresponding DNSKEY records. The Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS records can be used to help select the corresponding DNSKEY RR efficiently when more than one candidate DNSKEY RR is available.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to note that the key tag is not a unique identifier. It is theoretically possible for two distinct DNSKEY RRs to have the same owner name, the same algorithm, and the same key tag. The key tag is used to limit the possible candidate keys, but it does not uniquely identify a DNSKEY record. Implementations MUST NOT assume that the key tag uniquely identifies a DNSKEY RR.</p>
<p>The key tag is the same for all DNSKEY algorithm types except algorithm 1 (please see <a href="#key-tag-for-algorithm-1-rsamd5">Key Tag for Algorithm 1 (RSA/MD5)</a> for the definition of the key tag for algorithm 1). The key tag algorithm is the sum of the wire format of the DNSKEY RDATA broken into 2 octet groups. First, the RDATA (in wire format) is treated as a series of 2 octet groups. These groups are then added together, ignoring any carry bits.</p>
<p>A reference implementation of the key tag algorithm is as an ANSI C function is given below, with the RDATA portion of the DNSKEY RR is used as input. It is not necessary to use the following reference code verbatim, but the numerical value of the Key Tag MUST be identical to what the reference implementation would generate for the same input.</p>
<p>Please note that the algorithm for calculating the Key Tag is almost but not completely identical to the familiar ones-complement checksum used in many other Internet protocols. Key Tags MUST be calculated using the algorithm described here rather than the ones complement checksum.</p>
<p>The following ANSI C reference implementation calculates the value of a Key Tag. This reference implementation applies to all algorithm types except algorithm 1 (see <a href="#key-tag-for-algorithm-1-rsamd5">Key Tag for Algorithm 1 (RSA/MD5)</a>). The input is the wire format of the RDATA portion of the DNSKEY RR. The code is written for clarity, not efficiency.</p>

A zone that does not include these records according to the rules in this section is an unsigned zone.</p>
<p>DNSSEC specifies the placement of two new RR types, NSEC and DS, which can be placed at the parental side of a zone cut (that is, at a delegation point). This is an exception to the general prohibition against putting data in the parent zone at a zone cut. Section [x.x.x] describes this change.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.4.1" id="including-dnskey-rrs-in-a-zone"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.1</span> Including DNSKEY RRs in a Zone</h3>
<p>To sign a zone, the zone’s administrator generates one or more public/private key pairs and uses the private key(s) to sign authoritative RRsets in the zone. For each private key used to create RRSIG RRs in a zone, the zone SHOULD include a zone DNSKEY RR containing the corresponding public key. A zone key DNSKEY RR MUST have the Zone Key bit of the flags RDATA field set (see <a href="#the-flags-field">The Flags Field</a>). Public keys associated with other DNS operations MAY be stored in DNSKEY RRs that are not marked as zone keys but MUST NOT be used to verify RRSIGs.</p>
<p>If the zone administrator intends a signed zone to be usable other than as an island of security, the zone apex MUST contain at least one DNSKEY RR to act as a secure entry point into the zone. This secure entry point could then be used as the target of a secure delegation via a corresponding DS RR in the parent zone.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.4.2" id="including-rrsig-rrs-in-a-zone"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.2</span> Including RRSIG RRs in a Zone</h3>
<p>For each authoritative RRset in a signed zone, there MUST be at least one RRSIG record that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The RRSIG owner name is equal to the RRset owner name.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG class is equal to the RRset class.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG Type Covered field is equal to the RRset type.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG Original TTL field is equal to the TTL of the RRset.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG RR’s TTL is equal to the TTL of the RRset.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG Labels field is equal to the number of labels in the RRset owner name, not counting the null root label and not counting the leftmost label if it is a wildcard.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG Signer’s Name field is equal to the name of the zone containing the RRset.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG Algorithm, Signer’s Name, and Key Tag fields identify a zone key DNSKEY record at the zone apex.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An RRset MAY have multiple RRSIG RRs associated with it. Note that as RRSIG RRs are closely tied to the RRsets whose signatures they contain, RRSIG RRs, unlike all other DNS RR types, do not form RRsets. In particular, the TTL values among RRSIG RRs with a common owner name do not follow the RRset rules described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>An RRSIG RR itself MUST NOT be signed, as signing an RRSIG RR would add no value and would create an infinite loop in the signing process.</p>
<p>The NS RRset that appears at the zone apex name MUST be signed, but the NS RRsets that appear at delegation points (that is, the NS RRsets in the parent zone that delegate the name to the child zone’s name servers) MUST NOT be signed. Glue address RRsets associated with delegations MUST NOT be signed.</p>
<p>There MUST be an RRSIG for each RRset using at least one DNSKEY of each algorithm in the zone apex DNSKEY RRset. The apex DNSKEY RRset itself MUST be signed by each algorithm appearing in the DS RRset located at the delegating parent (if any).</p>
<h3 data-number="10.4.3" id="including-nsec-rrs-in-a-zone"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.3</span> Including NSEC RRs in a Zone</h3>
<p>Each owner name in the zone that has authoritative data or a delegation point NS RRset MUST have an NSEC resource record..</p>
<p>The TTL value for any NSEC RR SHOULD be the same as the minimum TTL value field in the zone SOA RR.</p>
<p>An NSEC record (and its associated RRSIG RRset) MUST NOT be the only RRset at any particular owner name. That is, the signing process MUST NOT create NSEC or RRSIG RRs for owner name nodes that were not the owner name of any RRset before the zone was signed. The main reasons for this are a desire for namespace consistency between signed and unsigned versions of the same zone and a desire to reduce the risk of response inconsistency in security oblivious recursive name servers.</p>
<p>The type bitmap of every NSEC resource record in a signed zone MUST indicate the presence of both the NSEC record itself and its corresponding RRSIG record.</p>
<p>The difference between the set of owner names that require RRSIG records and the set of owner names that require NSEC records is subtle and worth highlighting. RRSIG records are present at the owner names of all authoritative RRsets. NSEC records are present at the owner names of all names for which the signed zone is authoritative and also at the owner names of delegations from the signed zone to its children. Neither NSEC nor RRSIG records are present (in the parent zone) at the owner names of glue address RRsets. Note, however, that this distinction is for the most part visible only during the zone signing process, as NSEC RRsets are authoritative data and are therefore signed. Thus, any owner name that has an NSEC RRset will have RRSIG RRs as well in the signed zone.</p>
<p>The bitmap for the NSEC RR at a delegation point requires special attention. Bits corresponding to the delegation NS RRset and any RRsets for which the parent zone has authoritative data MUST be set; bits corresponding to any non-NS RRset for which the parent is not authoritative MUST be clear.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.4.4" id="including-ds-rrs-in-a-zone"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.4</span> Including DS RRs in a Zone</h3>
<p>The DS resource record establishes authentication chains between DNS zones. A DS RRset SHOULD be present at a delegation point when the child zone is signed. The DS RRset MAY contain multiple records, each referencing a public key in the child zone used to verify the RRSIGs in that zone. All DS RRsets in a zone MUST be signed, and DS RRsets MUST NOT appear at a zone’s apex.</p>
<p>A DS RR SHOULD point to a DNSKEY RR that is present in the child’s apex DNSKEY RRset, and the child’s apex DNSKEY RRset SHOULD be signed by the corresponding private key. DS RRs that fail to meet these conditions are not useful for validation, but because the DS RR and its corresponding DNSKEY RR are in different zones, and because the DNS is only loosely consistent, temporary mismatches can occur.</p>
<p>The TTL of a DS RRset SHOULD match the TTL of the delegating NS RRset (that is, the NS RRset from the same zone containing the DS RRset).</p>
<p>Construction of a DS RR requires knowledge of the corresponding DNSKEY RR in the child zone, which implies communication between the child and parent zones. This communication is an operational matter not covered by this document.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.4.5" id="dnssec-rr-types-appearing-at-zone-cuts"><span class="header-section-number">10.4.5</span> DNSSEC RR Types Appearing at Zone Cuts</h3>
<p>DNSSEC introduced two new RR types that are unusual in that they can appear at the parental side of a zone cut. At the parental side of a zone cut (that is, at a delegation point), NSEC RRs are REQUIRED at the owner name. A DS RR could also be present if the zone being delegated is signed and seeks to have a chain of authentication to the parent zone. This is an exception to the original DNS specification <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC-1034</a>, which states that only NS RRsets could appear at the parental side of a zone cut. These RRsets are authoritative for the parent when they appear at the parent side of a zone cut.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.5" id="serving"><span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> Serving</h2>
<p>This section describes the behavior of entities that include security-aware name server functions. In many cases such functions will be part of a security-aware recursive name server, but a security-aware authoritative name server has some of the same requirements. Functions specific to security-aware recursive name servers are described in [x.x.x]; functions specific to authoritative servers are described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>In the following discussion, the terms “SNAME”, “SCLASS”, and “STYPE” are as used in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>A security-aware name server MUST support the EDNS<code>0</code> (see [x.x.x]) message size extension, MUST support a message size of at least 1220 octets, and SHOULD support a message size of 4000 octets. As IPv6 packets can only be fragmented by the source host, a security aware name server SHOULD take steps to ensure that UDP datagrams it transmits over IPv6 are fragmented, if necessary, at the minimum IPv6 MTU, unless the path MTU is known. Please see <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC-1122</a>, <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt">RFC-2460</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3226.txt">RFC-3226</a> for further discussion of packet size and fragmentation issues.</p>
<p>A security-aware name server that receives a DNS query that does not include the EDNS OPT pseudo-RR or that has the DO bit clear MUST treat the RRSIG, DNSKEY, and NSEC RRs as it would any other RRset and MUST NOT perform any of the additional processing described below. Because the DS RR type has the peculiar property of only existing in the parent zone at delegation points, DS RRs always require some special processing, as described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>Security aware name servers that receive explicit queries for security RR types that match the content of more than one zone that it serves (for example, NSEC and RRSIG RRs above and below a delegation point where the server is authoritative for both zones) should behave self-consistently. As long as the response is always consistent for each query to the name server, the name server MAY return one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above-delegation RRsets.</li>
<li>The below-delegation RRsets.</li>
<li>Both above and below-delegation RRsets.</li>
<li>Empty answer section (no records).</li>
<li>Some other response.</li>
<li>An error.</li>
</ul>
<p>DNSSEC allocates two new bits in the DNS message header: the CD (Checking Disabled) bit and the AD (Authentic Data) bit. The CD bit is controlled by resolvers; a security-aware name server MUST copy the CD bit from a query into the corresponding response. The AD bit is controlled by name servers; a security-aware name server MUST ignore the setting of the AD bit in queries. See [x.x.x], [x.x.x], [x.x.x], [x.x.x], and [x.x.x] for details on the behavior of these bits.</p>
<p>A security aware name server that synthesizes CNAME RRs from DNAME RRs as described in [x.x.x] SHOULD NOT generate signatures for the synthesized CNAME RRs.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.5.1" id="authoritative-name-servers"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1</span> Authoritative Name Servers</h3>
<p>Upon receiving a relevant query that has the EDNS OPT pseudo-RR DO bit (see [x.x.x]) set, a security-aware authoritative name server for a signed zone MUST include additional RRSIG, NSEC, and DS RRs, according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RRSIG RRs that can be used to authenticate a response MUST be included in the response according to the rules in <a href="#including-rrsig-rrs-in-a-response">Including RRSIG RRs in a Response</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>NSEC RRs that can be used to provide authenticated denial of existence MUST be included in the response automatically according to the rules in <a href="#including-nsec-rrs-in-a-response">Including NSEC RRs in a Response</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Either a DS RRset or an NSEC RR proving that no DS RRs exist MUST be included in referrals automatically according to the rules in [x.x.x].</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules only apply to responses where the semantics convey information about the presence or absence of resource records. That is, these rules are not intended to rule out responses such as RCODE 4 (“Not Implemented”) or RCODE 5 (“Refused”).</p>
<p>DNSSEC does not change the DNS zone transfer protocol. [x.x.x] discusses zone transfer requirements.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.1" id="including-rrsig-rrs-in-a-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.1</span> Including RRSIG RRs in a Response</h4>
<p>When responding to a query that has the DO bit set, a security-aware authoritative name server SHOULD attempt to send RRSIG RRs that a security-aware resolver can use to authenticate the RRsets in the response. A name server SHOULD make every attempt to keep the RRset and its associated RRSIG(s) together in a response. Inclusion of RRSIG RRs in a response is subject to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When placing a signed RRset in the Answer section, the name server MUST also place its RRSIG RRs in the Answer section. The RRSIG RRs have a higher priority for inclusion than any other RRsets that may have to be included. If space does not permit inclusion of these RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing a signed RRset in the Authority section, the name server MUST also place its RRSIG RRs in the Authority section. The RRSIG RRs have a higher priority for inclusion than any other RRsets that may have to be included. If space does not permit inclusion of these RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p></li>
<li><p>When placing a signed RRset in the Additional section, the name server MUST also place its RRSIG RRs in the Additional section. If space does not permit inclusion of both the RRset and its associated RRSIG RRs, the name server MAY retain the RRset while dropping the RRSIG RRs. If this happens, the name server MUST NOT set the TC bit solely because these RRSIG RRs didn’t fit.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.2" id="including-dnskey-rrs-in-a-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.2</span> Including DNSKEY RRs in a Response</h4>
<p>When responding to a query that has the DO bit set and that requests the SOA or NS RRs at the apex of a signed zone, a security-aware authoritative name server for that zone MAY return the zone apex DNSKEY RRset in the Additional section. In this situation, the DNSKEY RRset and associated RRSIG RRs have lower priority than does any other information that would be placed in the additional section. The name server SHOULD NOT include the DNSKEY RRset unless there is enough space in the response message for both the DNSKEY RRset and its associated RRSIG RR(s). If there is not enough space to include these DNSKEY and RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST omit them and MUST NOT set the TC bit solely because these RRs didn’t fit (see <a href="#including-rrsig-rrs-in-a-response">Including RRSIG RRs in a Response</a>).</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.3" id="including-nsec-rrs-in-a-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3</span> Including NSEC RRs in a Response</h4>
<p>When responding to a query that has the DO bit set, a security-aware authoritative name server for a signed zone MUST include NSEC RRs in each of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No Data: The zone contains RRsets that exactly match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; but does not contain any RRsets that exactly match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p>Name Error: The zone does not contain any RRsets that match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; either exactly or via wildcard name expansion.</p></li>
<li><p>Wildcard Answer: The zone does not contain any RRsets that exactly match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; but does contain an RRset that matches &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt; via wildcard name expansion.</p></li>
<li><p>Wildcard No Data: The zone does not contain any RRsets that exactly match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; and does contain one or more RRsets that match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; via wildcard name expansion, but does not contain any RRsets that match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt; via wildcard name expansion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these cases, the name server includes NSEC RRs in the response to prove that an exact match for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt; was not present in the zone and that the response that the name server is returning is correct given the data in the zone.</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.3.1" id="including-nsec-rrs-no-data-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3.1</span> Including NSEC RRs: No Data Response</h5>
<p>If the zone contains RRsets matching &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; but contains no RRset matching &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt;, then the name server MUST include the NSEC RR for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; along with its associated RRSIG RR(s) in the Authority section of the response. If space does not permit inclusion of the NSEC RR or its associated RRSIG RR(s), the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p>
<p>Since the search name exists, wildcard name expansion does not apply to this query, and a single signed NSEC RR suffices to prove that the requested RR type does not exist.</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.3.2" id="including-nsec-rrs-name-error-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3.2</span> Including NSEC RRs: Name Error Response</h5>
<p>If the zone does not contain any RRsets matching &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; either exactly or via wildcard name expansion, then the name server MUST include the following NSEC RRs in the Authority section, along with their associated RRSIG RRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An NSEC RR proving that there is no exact match for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt;.</p></li>
<li><p>An NSEC RR proving that the zone contains no RRsets that would match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; via wildcard name expansion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, a single NSEC RR may prove both of these points. If it does, the name server SHOULD only include the NSEC RR and its RRSIG RR(s) once in the Authority section.</p>
<p>If space does not permit inclusion of these NSEC and RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p>
<p>The owner names of these NSEC and RRSIG RRs are not subject to wildcard name expansion when these RRs are included in the Authority section of the response.</p>
<p>Note that this form of response includes cases in which SNAME corresponds to an empty non-terminal name within the zone (a name that is not the owner name for any RRset but that is the parent name of one or more RRsets).</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.3.3" id="including-nsec-rrs-wildcard-answer-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3.3</span> Including NSEC RRs: Wildcard Answer Response</h5>
<p>If the zone does not contain any RRsets that exactly match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; but does contain an RRset that matches &lt;SNAME, SCLASS, STYPE&gt; via wildcard name expansion, the name server MUST include the wildcard-expanded answer and the corresponding wildcard-expanded RRSIG RRs in the Answer section and MUST include in the Authority section an NSEC RR and associated RRSIG RR(s) proving that the zone does not contain a closer match for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt;. If space does not permit inclusion of the answer, NSEC and RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.3.4" id="including-nsec-rrs-wildcard-no-data-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3.4</span> Including NSEC RRs: Wildcard No Data Response</h5>
<p>This case is a combination of the previous cases. The zone does not contain an exact match for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt;, and although the zone does contain RRsets that match &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; via wildcard expansion, none of those RRsets matches STYPE. The name server MUST include the following NSEC RRs in the Authority section, along with their associated RRSIG RRs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An NSEC RR proving that there are no RRsets matching STYPE at the wildcard owner name that matched &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt; via wildcard expansion.</p></li>
<li><p>An NSEC RR proving that there are no RRsets in the zone that would have been a closer match for &lt;SNAME, SCLASS&gt;.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, a single NSEC RR may prove both of these points. If it does, the name server SHOULD only include the NSEC RR and its RRSIG RR(s) once in the Authority section.</p>
<p>The owner names of these NSEC and RRSIG RRs are not subject to wildcard name expansion when these RRs are included in the Authority section of the response.</p>
<p>If space does not permit inclusion of these NSEC and RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.3.5" id="finding-the-right-nsec-rrs"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.3.5</span> Finding the Right NSEC RRs</h5>
<p>As explained above, there are several situations in which a security-aware authoritative name server has to locate an NSEC RR that proves that no RRsets matching a particular SNAME exist. Locating such an NSEC RR within an authoritative zone is relatively simple, at least in concept. The following discussion assumes that the name server is authoritative for the zone that would have held the non-existent RRsets matching SNAME. The algorithm below is written for clarity, not for efficiency.</p>
<p>To find the NSEC that proves that no RRsets matching name N exist in the zone Z that would have held them, construct a sequence, S, consisting of the owner names of every RRset in Z, sorted into canonical order (see [x.x.x]), with no duplicate names. Find the name M that would have immediately preceded N in S if any RRsets with owner name N had existed. M is the owner name of the NSEC RR that proves that no RRsets exist with owner name N.</p>
<p>The algorithm for finding the NSEC RR that proves that a given name is not covered by any applicable wildcard is similar but requires an extra step. More precisely, the algorithm for finding the NSEC proving that no RRsets exist with the applicable wildcard name is precisely the same as the algorithm for finding the NSEC RR that proves that RRsets with any other owner name do not exist. The part that’s missing is a method of determining the name of the non- existent applicable wildcard. In practice, this is easy, because the authoritative name server has already checked for the presence of precisely this wildcard name as part of step (1)(c) of the normal lookup algorithm described in [x.x.x].</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.4" id="including-ds-rrs-in-a-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.4</span> Including DS RRs in a Response</h4>
<p>When responding to a query that has the DO bit set, a security-aware authoritative name server returning a referral includes DNSSEC data along with the NS RRset.</p>
<p>If a DS RRset is present at the delegation point, the name server MUST return both the DS RRset and its associated RRSIG RR(s) in the Authority section along with the NS RRset.</p>
<p>If no DS RRset is present at the delegation point, the name server MUST return both the NSEC RR that proves that the DS RRset is not present and the NSEC RR’s associated RRSIG RR(s) along with the NS RRset. The name server MUST place the NS RRset before the NSEC RRset and its associated RRSIG RR(s).</p>
<p>Including these DS, NSEC, and RRSIG RRs increases the size of referral messages and may cause some or all glue RRs to be omitted. If space does not permit inclusion of the DS or NSEC RRset and associated RRSIG RRs, the name server MUST set the TC bit.</p>
<h5 data-number="10.5.1.4.1" id="responding-to-queries-for-ds-rrs"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.4.1</span> Responding to Queries for DS RRs</h5>
<p>The DS resource record type is unusual in that it appears only on the parent zone’s side of a zone cut. For example, the DS RRset for the delegation of “foo.example” is stored in the “example” zone rather than in the “foo.example” zone. This requires special processing rules for both name servers and resolvers, as the name server for the child zone is authoritative for the name at the zone cut by the normal DNS rules but the child zone does not contain the DS RRset. A security-aware resolver sends queries to the parent zone when looking for a needed DS RR at a delegation point (see Section 4.2). However, special rules are necessary to avoid confusing security-oblivious resolvers which might become involved in processing such a query (for example, in a network configuration that forces a security-aware resolver to channel its queries through a security-oblivious recursive name server). The rest of this section describes how a security-aware name server processes DS queries in order to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>The need for special processing by a security-aware name server only arises when all the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The name server has received a query for the DS RRset at a zone cut.</p></li>
<li><p>The name server is authoritative for the child zone.</p></li>
<li><p>The name server is not authoritative for the parent zone.</p></li>
<li><p>The name server does not offer recursion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, the name server either has some way of obtaining the DS RRset or could not have been expected to have the DS RRset even by the pre-DNSSEC processing rules, so the name server can return either the DS RRset or an error response according to the normal processing rules.</p>
<p>If all the above conditions are met, however, the name server is authoritative for SNAME but cannot supply the requested RRset. In this case, the name server MUST return an authoritative “no data” response showing that the DS RRset does not exist in the child zone’s apex. See [x.x.x] for an example of such a response.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.5" id="responding-to-queries-for-type-axfr-or-ixfr"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.5</span> Responding to Queries for Type AXFR or IXFR</h4>
<p>DNSSEC does not change the DNS zone transfer process. A signed zone will contain RRSIG, DNSKEY, NSEC, and DS resource records, but these records have no special meaning with respect to a zone transfer operation.</p>
<p>An authoritative name server is not required to verify that a zone is properly signed before sending or accepting a zone transfer. However, an authoritative name server MAY choose to reject the entire zone transfer if the zone fails to meet any of the signing requirements described in [x.x.x]. The primary objective of a zone transfer is to ensure that all authoritative name servers have identical copies of the zone. An authoritative name server that chooses to perform its own zone validation MUST NOT selectively reject some RRs and accept others.</p>
<p>DS RRsets appear only on the parental side of a zone cut and are authoritative data in the parent zone. As with any other authoritative RRset, the DS RRset MUST be included in zone transfers of the zone in which the RRset is authoritative data. In the case of the DS RRset, this is the parent zone.</p>
<p>NSEC RRs appear in both the parent and child zones at a zone cut and are authoritative data in both the parent and child zones. The parental and child NSEC RRs at a zone cut are never identical to each other, as the NSEC RR in the child zone’s apex will always indicate the presence of the child zone’s SOA RR whereas the parental NSEC RR at the zone cut will never indicate the presence of an SOA RR. As with any other authoritative RRs, NSEC RRs MUST be included in zone transfers of the zone in which they are authoritative data. The parental NSEC RR at a zone cut MUST be included in zone transfers of the parent zone, and the NSEC at the zone apex of the child zone MUST be included in zone transfers of the child zone.</p>
<p>RRSIG RRs appear in both the parent and child zones at a zone cut and are authoritative in whichever zone contains the authoritative RRset for which the RRSIG RR provides the signature. That is, the RRSIG RR for a DS RRset or a parental NSEC RR at a zone cut will be authoritative in the parent zone, and the RRSIG for any RRset in the child zone’s apex will be authoritative in the child zone. Parental and child RRSIG RRs at a zone cut will never be identical to each other, as the Signer’s Name field of an RRSIG RR in the child zone’s apex will indicate a DNSKEY RR in the child zone’s apex whereas the same field of a parental RRSIG RR at the zone cut will indicate a DNSKEY RR in the parent zone’s apex. As with any other authoritative RRs, RRSIG RRs MUST be included in zone transfers of the zone in which they are authoritative data.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.1.6" id="the-ad-and-cd-bits-in-an-authoritative-response"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.1.6</span> The AD and CD Bits in an Authoritative Response</h4>
<p>The CD and AD bits are designed for use in communication between security-aware resolvers and security-aware recursive name servers. These bits are for the most part not relevant to query processing by security-aware authoritative name servers.</p>
<p>A security-aware name server does not perform signature validation for authoritative data during query processing, even when the CD bit is clear. A security-aware name server SHOULD clear the CD bit when composing an authoritative response.</p>
<p>A security-aware name server MUST NOT set the AD bit in a response unless the name server considers all RRsets in the Answer and Authority sections of the response to be authentic. A security-aware name server’s local policy MAY consider data from an authoritative zone to be authentic without further validation. However, the name server MUST NOT do so unless the name server obtained the authoritative zone via secure means (such as a secure zone transfer mechanism) and MUST NOT do so unless this behavior has been configured explicitly.</p>
<p>A security-aware name server that supports recursion MUST follow the rules for the CD and AD bits given in [x.x.x] when generating a response that involves data obtained via recursion.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.5.2" id="recursive-name-servers"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.2</span> Recursive Name Servers</h3>
<p>As explained in [x.x.x], a security-aware recursive name server is an entity that acts in both the security-aware name server and security-aware resolver roles. This section uses the terms “name server side” and “resolver side” to refer to the code within a security-aware recursive name server that implements the security-aware name server role and the code that implements the security-aware resolver role, respectively.</p>
<p>The resolver side follows the usual rules for caching and negative caching that would apply to any security-aware resolver.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.2.1" id="the-do-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.2.1</span> The DO Bit</h4>
<p>The resolver side of a security-aware recursive name server MUST set the DO bit when sending requests, regardless of the state of the DO bit in the initiating request received by the name server side. If the DO bit in an initiating query is not set, the name server side MUST strip any authenticating DNSSEC RRs from the response but MUST NOT strip any DNSSEC RR types that the initiating query explicitly requested.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.2.2" id="the-cd-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.2.2</span> The CD Bit</h4>
<p>The CD bit exists in order to allow a security-aware resolver to disable signature validation in a security-aware name server’s processing of a particular query.</p>
<p>The name server side MUST copy the setting of the CD bit from a query to the corresponding response.</p>
<p>The name server side of a security-aware recursive name server MUST pass the state of the CD bit to the resolver side along with the rest of an initiating query, so that the resolver side will know whether it is required to verify the response data it returns to the name server side. If the CD bit is set, it indicates that the originating resolver is willing to perform whatever authentication its local policy requires. Thus, the resolver side of the recursive name server need not perform authentication on the RRsets in the response. When the CD bit is set, the recursive name server SHOULD, if possible, return the requested data to the originating resolver, even if the recursive name server’s local authentication policy would reject the records in question. That is, by setting the CD bit, the originating resolver has indicated that it takes responsibility for performing its own authentication, and the recursive name server should not interfere.</p>
<p>If the resolver side implements a BAD cache (see [x.x.x]) and the name server side receives a query that matches an entry in the resolver side’s BAD cache, the name server side’s response depends on the state of the CD bit in the original query. If the CD bit is set, the name server side SHOULD return the data from the BAD cache; if the CD bit is not set, the name server side MUST return RCODE 2 (server failure).</p>
<p>The intent of the above rule is to provide the raw data to clients that are capable of performing their own signature verification checks while protecting clients that depend on the resolver side of a security-aware recursive name server to perform such checks. Several of the possible reasons why signature validation might fail involve conditions that may not apply equally to the recursive name server and the client that invoked it. For example, the recursive name server’s clock may be set incorrectly, or the client may have knowledge of a relevant island of security that the recursive name server does not share. In such cases, “protecting” a client that is capable of performing its own signature validation from ever seeing the “bad” data does not help the client.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.5.2.3" id="the-ad-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.5.2.3</span> The AD Bit</h4>
<p>The name server side of a security-aware recursive name server MUST NOT set the AD bit in a response unless the name server considers all RRsets in the Answer and Authority sections of the response to be authentic. The name server side SHOULD set the AD bit if and only if the resolver side considers all RRsets in the Answer section and any relevant negative response RRs in the Authority section to be authentic. The resolver side MUST follow the procedure described in Section 5 to determine whether the RRs in question are authentic. However, for backward compatibility, a recursive name server MAY set the AD bit when a response includes unsigned CNAME RRs if those CNAME RRs demonstrably could have been synthesized from an authentic DNAME RR that is also included in the response according to the synthesis rules described in [x.x.x].</p>
<h2 data-number="10.6" id="resolving"><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> Resolving</h2>
<p>This section describes the behavior of entities that include security-aware resolver functions. In many cases such functions will be part of a security-aware recursive name server, but a stand-alone security-aware resolver has many of the same requirements. Functions specific to security-aware recursive name servers are described in [x.x.x].</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.1" id="edns-support"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.1</span> EDNS Support</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST include an EDNS OPT pseudo-RR with the DO bit set when sending queries.</p>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST support a message size of at least 1220 octets, SHOULD support a message size of 4000 octets, and MUST use the “sender’s UDP payload size” field in the EDNS OPT pseudo-RR to advertise the message size that it is willing to accept. A security-aware resolver’s IP layer MUST handle fragmented UDP packets correctly regardless of whether any such fragmented packets were received via IPv4 or IPv6. Please see <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc1122.txt">RFC-1122</a>, <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt">RFC-2460</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/rfc/rfc3226.txt">RFC-3226</a> for discussion of these requirements.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.2" id="signature-verification-support"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.2</span> Signature Verification Support</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST support the signature verification mechanisms described in [x.x.x] and SHOULD apply them to every received response, except when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the security-aware resolver is part of a security-aware recursive name server, and the response is the result of recursion on behalf of a query received with the CD bit set</p></li>
<li><p>the response is the result of a query generated directly via some form of application interface that instructed the security-aware resolver not to perform validation for this query</p></li>
<li><p>validation for this query has been disabled by local policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A security-aware resolver’s support for signature verification MUST include support for verification of wildcard owner names.</p>
<p>Security-aware resolvers MAY query for missing security RRs in an attempt to perform validation; implementations that choose to do so must be aware that the answers received may not be sufficient to validate the original response. For example, a zone update may have changed (or deleted) the desired information between the original and follow-up queries.</p>
<p>When attempting to retrieve missing NSEC RRs that reside on the parental side at a zone cut, a security-aware iterative-mode resolver MUST query the name servers for the parent zone, not the child zone.</p>
<p>When attempting to retrieve a missing DS, a security-aware iterative-mode resolver MUST query the name servers for the parent zone, not the child zone. As explained in <a href="#responding-to-queries-for-ds-rrs">Responding to Queries for DS RRs</a>, security-aware name servers need to apply special processing rules to handle the DS RR, and in some situations the resolver may also need to apply special rules to locate the name servers for the parent zone if the resolver does not already have the parent’s NS RRset. To locate the parent NS RRset, the resolver can start with the delegation name, strip off the leftmost label, and query for an NS RRset by that name. If no NS RRset is present at that name, the resolver then strips off the leftmost remaining label and retries the query for that name, repeating this process of walking up the tree until it either finds the NS RRset or runs out of labels.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.3" id="determining-security-status-of-data"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.3</span> Determining Security Status of Data</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST be able to determine whether it should expect a particular RRset to be signed. More precisely, a security-aware resolver must be able to distinguish between four cases:</p>
<p><strong>Secure</strong>: An RRset for which the resolver is able to build a chain of signed DNSKEY and DS RRs from a trusted security anchor to the RRset. In this case, the RRset should be signed and is subject to signature validation, as described above.</p>
<p><strong>Insecure</strong>: An RRset for which the resolver knows that it has no chain of signed DNSKEY and DS RRs from any trusted starting point to the RRset. This can occur when the target RRset lies in an unsigned zone or in a descendent of an unsigned zone. In this case, the RRset may or may not be signed, but the resolver will not be able to verify the signature.</p>
<p><strong>Bogus</strong>: An RRset for which the resolver believes that it ought to be able to establish a chain of trust but for which it is unable to do so, either due to signatures that for some reason fail to validate or due to missing data that the relevant DNSSEC RRs indicate should be present. This case may indicate an attack but may also indicate a configuration error or some form of data corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Indeterminate</strong>: An RRset for which the resolver is not able to determine whether the RRset should be signed, as the resolver is not able to obtain the necessary DNSSEC RRs. This can occur when the security-aware resolver is not able to contact security-aware name servers for the relevant zones.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.4" id="configured-trust-anchors"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.4</span> Configured Trust Anchors</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST be capable of being configured with at least one trusted public key or DS RR and SHOULD be capable of being configured with multiple trusted public keys or DS RRs. Since a security-aware resolver will not be able to validate signatures without such a configured trust anchor, the resolver SHOULD have some reasonably robust mechanism for obtaining such keys when it boots; examples of such a mechanism would be some form of non-volatile storage (such as a disk drive) or some form of trusted local network configuration mechanism.</p>
<p>Note that trust anchors also cover key material that is updated in a secure manner. This secure manner could be through physical media, a key exchange protocol, or some other out-of-band means.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.5" id="response-caching"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.5</span> Response Caching</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver SHOULD cache each response as a single atomic entry containing the entire answer, including the named RRset and any associated DNSSEC RRs. The resolver SHOULD discard the entire atomic entry when any of the RRs contained in it expire. In most cases the appropriate cache index for the atomic entry will be the triple &lt;QNAME, QTYPE, QCLASS&gt;, but in cases such as the response form described in <a href="#including-nsec-rrs-name-error-response">Including NSEC RRs: Name Error Response</a> the appropriate cache index will be the double &lt;QNAME,QCLASS&gt;.</p>
<p>The reason for these recommendations is that, between the initial query and the expiration of the data from the cache, the authoritative data might have been changed (for example, via dynamic update).</p>
<p>There are two situations for which this is relevant:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>By using the RRSIG record, it is possible to deduce that an answer was synthesized from a wildcard. A security-aware recursive name server could store this wildcard data and use it to generate positive responses to queries other than the name for which the original answer was first received.</p></li>
<li><p>NSEC RRs received to prove the non-existence of a name could be reused by a security-aware resolver to prove the non-existence of any name in the name range it spans.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In theory, a resolver could use wildcards or NSEC RRs to generate positive and negative responses (respectively) until the TTL or signatures on the records in question expire. However, it seems prudent for resolvers to avoid blocking new authoritative data or synthesizing new data on their own. Resolvers that follow this recommendation will have a more consistent view of the namespace.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.6" id="handling-of-the-cd-and-ad-bits"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.6</span> Handling of the CD and AD Bits</h3>
<p>A security-aware resolver MAY set a query’s CD bit in order to indicate that the resolver takes responsibility for performing whatever authentication its local policy requires on the RRsets in the response. See <a href="#recursive-name-servers">Recursive Name Servers</a> for the effect this bit has on the behavior of security-aware recursive name servers.</p>
<p>A security-aware resolver MUST clear the AD bit when composing query messages to protect against buggy name servers that blindly copy header bits that they do not understand from the query message to the response message.</p>
<p>A resolver MUST disregard the meaning of the CD and AD bits in a response unless the response was obtained by using a secure channel or the resolver was specifically configured to regard the message header bits without using a secure channel.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.7" id="caching-bad-data"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.7</span> Caching BAD Data</h3>
<p>While many validation errors will be transient, some are likely to be more persistent, such as those caused by administrative error (failure to re-sign a zone, clock skew, and so forth). Since requerying will not help in these cases, validating resolvers might generate a significant amount of unnecessary DNS traffic as a result of repeated queries for RRsets with persistent validation failures.</p>
<p>To prevent such unnecessary DNS traffic, security-aware resolvers MAY cache data with invalid signatures, with some restrictions.</p>
<p>Conceptually, caching such data is similar to negative caching, except that instead of caching a valid negative response, the resolver is caching the fact that a particular answer failed to validate. This document refers to a cache of data with invalid signatures as a “BAD cache”.</p>
<p>Resolvers that implement a BAD cache MUST take steps to prevent the cache from being useful as a denial-of-service attack amplifier, particularly the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Since RRsets that fail to validate do not have trustworthy TTLs, the implementation MUST assign a TTL. This TTL SHOULD be small, in order to mitigate the effect of caching the results of an attack.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to prevent caching of a transient validation failure (which might be the result of an attack), resolvers SHOULD track queries that result in validation failures and SHOULD only answer from the BAD cache after the number of times that responses to queries for that particular &lt;QNAME, QTYPE, QCLASS&gt; have failed to validate exceeds a threshold value.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Resolvers MUST NOT return RRsets from the BAD cache unless the resolver is not required to validate the signatures of the RRsets in question under the rules given in <a href="#signature-verification-support">Signature Verification Support</a>. See <a href="#the-cd-bit">The CD Bit</a> for discussion of how the responses returned by a security-aware recursive name server interact with a BAD cache.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.8" id="synthesized-cnames"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.8</span> Synthesized CNAMEs</h3>
<p>A validating security-aware resolver MUST treat the signature of a valid signed DNAME RR as also covering unsigned CNAME RRs that could have been synthesized from the DNAME RR, as described in [x.x.x], at least to the extent of not rejecting a response message solely because it contains such CNAME RRs. The resolver MAY retain such CNAME RRs in its cache or in the answers it hands back, but is not required to do so.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.6.9" id="stub-resolvers-1"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.9</span> Stub Resolvers</h3>
<p>A security-aware stub resolver MUST support the DNSSEC RR types, at least to the extent of not mishandling responses just because they contain DNSSEC RRs.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.6.9.1" id="handling-of-the-do-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.9.1</span> Handling of the DO Bit</h4>
<p>A non-validating security-aware stub resolver MAY include the DNSSEC RRs returned by a security-aware recursive name server as part of the data that the stub resolver hands back to the application that invoked it, but is not required to do so. A non-validating stub resolver that seeks to do this will need to set the DO bit in order to receive DNSSEC RRs from the recursive name server.</p>
<p>A validating security-aware stub resolver MUST set the DO bit, because otherwise it will not receive the DNSSEC RRs it needs to perform signature validation.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.6.9.2" id="handling-of-the-cd-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.9.2</span> Handling of the CD Bit</h4>
<p>A non-validating security-aware stub resolver SHOULD NOT set the CD bit when sending queries unless it is requested by the application layer, as by definition, a non-validating stub resolver depends on the security-aware recursive name server to perform validation on its behalf.</p>
<p>A validating security-aware stub resolver SHOULD set the CD bit, because otherwise the security-aware recursive name server will answer the query using the name server’s local policy, which may prevent the stub resolver from receiving data that would be acceptable to the stub resolver’s local policy.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.6.9.3" id="handling-of-the-ad-bit"><span class="header-section-number">10.6.9.3</span> Handling of the AD Bit</h4>
<p>A non-validating security-aware stub resolver MAY chose to examine the setting of the AD bit in response messages that it receives in order to determine whether the security-aware recursive name server that sent the response claims to have cryptographically verified the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response message. Note, however, that the responses received by a security-aware stub resolver are heavily dependent on the local policy of the security-aware recursive name server. Therefore, there may be little practical value in checking the status of the AD bit, except perhaps as a debugging aid. In any case, a security-aware stub resolver MUST NOT place any reliance on signature validation allegedly performed on its behalf, except when the security-aware stub resolver obtained the data in question from a trusted security-aware recursive name server via a secure channel.</p>
<p>A validating security-aware stub resolver SHOULD NOT examine the setting of the AD bit in response messages, as, by definition, the stub resolver performs its own signature validation regardless of the setting of the AD bit.</p>
<h2 data-number="10.7" id="authenticating-dns-responses"><span class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Authenticating DNS Responses</h2>
<p>To use DNSSEC RRs for authentication, a security-aware resolver requires configured knowledge of at least one authenticated DNSKEY or DS RR. The process for obtaining and authenticating this initial “trust anchor” is achieved via some external mechanism. For example, a resolver could use some off-line authenticated exchange to obtain a zone’s DNSKEY RR or to obtain a DS RR that identifies and authenticates a zone’s DNSKEY RR. The remainder of this section assumes that the resolver has somehow obtained an initial set of trust anchors.</p>
<p>An initial DNSKEY RR can be used to authenticate a zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset. To authenticate an apex DNSKEY RRset by using an initial key, the resolver MUST:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>verify that the initial DNSKEY RR appears in the apex DNSKEY RRset, and that the DNSKEY RR has the Zone Key Flag (DNSKEY RDATA bit 7) set; and</p></li>
<li><p>verify that there is some RRSIG RR that covers the apex DNSKEY RRset, and that the combination of the RRSIG RR and the initial DNSKEY RR authenticates the DNSKEY RRset. The process for using an RRSIG RR to authenticate an RRset is described in <a href="#authenticating-an-rrset-with-an-rrsig-rr">Authenticating an RRSet with an RRSIG RR</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the resolver has authenticated the apex DNSKEY RRset by using an initial DNSKEY RR, delegations from that zone can be authenticated by using DS RRs. This allows a resolver to start from an initial key and use DS RRsets to proceed recursively down the DNS tree, obtaining other apex DNSKEY RRsets. If the resolver were configured with a root DNSKEY RR, and if every delegation had a DS RR associated with it, then the resolver could obtain and validate any apex DNSKEY RRset. The process of using DS RRs to authenticate referrals is described in <a href="#authenticating-referrals">Authenticating Referrals</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#authenticating-an-rrset-with-an-rrsig-rr">Authenticating an RRSet with an RRSIG RR</a> shows how the resolver can use DNSKEY RRs in the apex DNSKEY RRset and RRSIG RRs from the zone to authenticate any other RRsets in the zone once the resolver has authenticated a zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset. [x.x.x] shows how the resolver can use authenticated NSEC RRsets from the zone to prove that an RRset is not present in the zone.</p>
<p>When a resolver indicates support for DNSSEC (by setting the DO bit), a security-aware name server should attempt to provide the necessary DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, and DS RRsets in a response (see [x.x.x]). However, a security-aware resolver may still receive a response that lacks the appropriate DNSSEC RRs, whether due to configuration issues such as an upstream security-oblivious recursive name server that accidentally interferes with DNSSEC RRs or due to a deliberate attack in which an adversary forges a response, strips DNSSEC RRs from a response, or modifies a query so that DNSSEC RRs appear not to be requested. The absence of DNSSEC data in a response MUST NOT by itself be taken as an indication that no authentication information exists.</p>
<p>A resolver SHOULD expect authentication information from signed zones. A resolver SHOULD believe that a zone is signed if the resolver has been configured with public key information for the zone, or if the zone’s parent is signed and the delegation from the parent contains a DS RRset.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.7.1" id="special-considerations-for-islands-of-security"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.1</span> Special Considerations for Islands of Security</h3>
<p>Islands of security are signed zones for which it is not possible to construct an authentication chain to the zone from its parent. Validating signatures within an island of security requires that the validator have some other means of obtaining an initial authenticated zone key for the island. If a validator cannot obtain such a key, it SHOULD switch to operating as if the zones in the island of security are unsigned.</p>
<p>All the normal processes for validating responses apply to islands of security. The only difference between normal validation and validation within an island of security is in how the validator obtains a trust anchor for the authentication chain.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.7.2" id="authenticating-referrals"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.2</span> Authenticating Referrals</h3>
<p>Once the apex DNSKEY RRset for a signed parent zone has been authenticated, DS RRsets can be used to authenticate the delegation to a signed child zone. A DS RR identifies a DNSKEY RR in the child zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset and contains a cryptographic digest of the child zone’s DNSKEY RR. Use of a strong cryptographic digest algorithm ensures that it is computationally infeasible for an adversary to generate a DNSKEY RR that matches the digest. Thus, authenticating the digest allows a resolver to authenticate the matching DNSKEY RR. The resolver can then use this child DNSKEY RR to authenticate the entire child apex DNSKEY RRset.</p>
<p>Given a DS RR for a delegation, the child zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset can be authenticated if all of the following hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The DS RR has been authenticated using some DNSKEY RR in the parent’s apex DNSKEY RRset (see [Authenticating an RRSet with an RRSIG RR).</p></li>
<li><p>The Algorithm and Key Tag in the DS RR match the Algorithm field and the key tag of a DNSKEY RR in the child zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset, and, when the DNSKEY RR’s owner name and RDATA are hashed using the digest algorithm specified in the DS RR’s Digest Type field, the resulting digest value matches the Digest field of the DS RR.</p></li>
<li><p>The matching DNSKEY RR in the child zone has the Zone Flag bit set, the corresponding private key has signed the child zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset, and the resulting RRSIG RR authenticates the child zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the referral from the parent zone did not contain a DS RRset, the response should have included a signed NSEC RRset proving that no DS RRset exists for the delegated name (see [x.x.x]). A security-aware resolver MUST query the name servers for the parent zone for the DS RRset if the referral includes neither a DS RRset nor a NSEC RRset proving that the DS RRset does not exist (see [x.x.x]).</p>
<p>If the validator authenticates an NSEC RRset that proves that no DS RRset is present for this zone, then there is no authentication path leading from the parent to the child. If the resolver has an initial DNSKEY or DS RR that belongs to the child zone or to any delegation below the child zone, this initial DNSKEY or DS RR MAY be used to re-establish an authentication path. If no such initial DNSKEY or DS RR exists, the validator cannot authenticate RRsets in or below the child zone.</p>
<p>If the validator does not support any of the algorithms listed in an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver has no supported authentication path leading from the parent to the child. The resolver should treat this case as it would the case of an authenticated NSEC RRset proving that no DS RRset exists, as described above.</p>
<p>Note that, for a signed delegation, there are two NSEC RRs associated with the delegated name. One NSEC RR resides in the parent zone and can be used to prove whether a DS RRset exists for the delegated name. The second NSEC RR resides in the child zone and identifies which RRsets are present at the apex of the child zone. The parent NSEC RR and child NSEC RR can always be distinguished because the SOA bit will be set in the child NSEC RR and clear in the parent NSEC RR. A security-aware resolver MUST use the parent NSEC RR when attempting to prove that a DS RRset does not exist.</p>
<p>If the resolver does not support any of the algorithms listed in an authenticated DS RRset, then the resolver will not be able to verify the authentication path to the child zone. In this case, the resolver SHOULD treat the child zone as if it were unsigned.</p>
<h3 data-number="10.7.3" id="authenticating-an-rrset-with-an-rrsig-rr"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.3</span> Authenticating an RRSet with an RRSIG RR</h3>
<p>A validator can use an RRSIG RR and its corresponding DNSKEY RR to attempt to authenticate RRsets. The validator first checks the RRSIG RR to verify that it covers the RRset, has a valid time interval, and identifies a valid DNSKEY RR. The validator then constructs the canonical form of the signed data by appending the RRSIG RDATA (excluding the Signature Field) with the canonical form of the covered RRset. Finally, the validator uses the public key and signature to authenticate the signed data. Sections [x.x.x], [x.x.x], and [x.x.x] describe each step in detail.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.7.3.1" id="checking-the-rrsig-rr-validity"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.3.1</span> Checking the RRSIG RR Validity</h4>
<p>A security-aware resolver can use an RRSIG RR to authenticate an RRset if all of the following conditions hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The RRSIG RR and the RRset MUST have the same owner name and the same class.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG RR’s Signer’s Name field MUST be the name of the zone that contains the RRset.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG RR’s Type Covered field MUST equal the RRset’s type.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of labels in the RRset owner name MUST be greater than or equal to the value in the RRSIG RR’s Labels field.</p></li>
<li><p>The validator’s notion of the current time MUST be less than or equal to the time listed in the RRSIG RR’s Expiration field.</p></li>
<li><p>The validator’s notion of the current time MUST be greater than or equal to the time listed in the RRSIG RR’s Inception field.</p></li>
<li><p>The RRSIG RR’s Signer’s Name, Algorithm, and Key Tag fields MUST match the owner name, algorithm, and key tag for some DNSKEY RR in the zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset.</p></li>
<li><p>The matching DNSKEY RR MUST be present in the zone’s apex DNSKEY RRset, and MUST have the Zone Flag bit (DNSKEY RDATA Flag bit 7) set.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for more than one DNSKEY RR to match the conditions above. In this case, the validator cannot predetermine which DNSKEY RR to use to authenticate the signature, and it MUST try each matching DNSKEY RR until either the signature is validated or the validator has run out of matching public keys to try.</p>
<p>Note that this authentication process is only meaningful if the validator authenticates the DNSKEY RR before using it to validate signatures. The matching DNSKEY RR is considered to be authentic if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the apex DNSKEY RRset containing the DNSKEY RR is considered authentic; or</p></li>
<li><p>the RRset covered by the RRSIG RR is the apex DNSKEY RRset itself, and the DNSKEY RR either matches an authenticated DS RR from the parent zone or matches a trust anchor.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 data-number="10.7.3.2" id="reconstructing-the-signed-data"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.3.2</span> Reconstructing the Signed Data</h4>
<p>Once the RRSIG RR has met the validity requirements described in <a href="#checking-the-rrsig-rr-validity">Checking the RRSIG RR Validity</a>, the validator has to reconstruct the original signed data. The original signed data includes RRSIG RDATA (excluding the Signature field) and the canonical form of the RRset. Aside from being ordered, the canonical form of the RRset might also differ from the received RRset due to DNS name compression, decremented TTLs, or wildcard expansion. The validator should use the following to reconstruct the original signed data:</p>
<pre><code>signed_data = RRSIG_RDATA | RR(1) | RR(2)... where

&quot;|&quot; denotes concatenation

RRSIG_RDATA is the wire format of the RRSIG RDATA fields
    with the Signature field excluded and the Signer&#39;s Name
    in canonical form.

RR(i) = name | type | class | OrigTTL | RDATA length | RDATA

    name is calculated according to the function below

    class is the RRset&#39;s class

    type is the RRset type and all RRs in the class

    OrigTTL is the value from the RRSIG Original TTL field

    All names in the RDATA field are in canonical form

    The set of all RR(i) is sorted into canonical order.

To calculate the name:
    let rrsig_labels = the value of the RRSIG Labels field

    let fqdn = RRset&#39;s fully qualified domain name in
                    canonical form

    let fqdn_labels = Label count of the fqdn above.

    if rrsig_labels = fqdn_labels,
        name = fqdn

    if rrsig_labels &lt; fqdn_labels,
        name = &quot;*.&quot; | the rightmost rrsig_label labels of the
                    fqdn

    if rrsig_labels &gt; fqdn_labels
        the RRSIG RR did not pass the necessary validation
        checks and MUST NOT be used to authenticate this
        RRset.</code></pre>
<p>The canonical forms for names and RRsets are defined in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>NSEC RRsets at a delegation boundary require special processing. There are two distinct NSEC RRsets associated with a signed delegated name. One NSEC RRset resides in the parent zone, and specifies which RRsets are present at the parent zone. The second NSEC RRset resides at the child zone and identifies which RRsets are present at the apex in the child zone. The parent NSEC RRset and child NSEC RRset can always be distinguished as only a child NSEC RR will indicate that an SOA RRset exists at the name. When reconstructing the original NSEC RRset for the delegation from the parent zone, the NSEC RRs MUST NOT be combined with NSEC RRs from the child zone. When reconstructing the original NSEC RRset for the apex of the child zone, the NSEC RRs MUST NOT be combined with NSEC RRs from the parent zone.</p>
<p>Note that each of the two NSEC RRsets at a delegation point has a corresponding RRSIG RR with an owner name matching the delegated name, and each of these RRSIG RRs is authoritative data associated with the same zone that contains the corresponding NSEC RRset. If necessary, a resolver can tell these RRSIG RRs apart by checking the Signer’s Name field.</p>
<h4 data-number="10.7.3.3" id="checking-the-signature"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.3.3</span> Checking the Signature</h4>
<p>Once the resolver has validated the RRSIG RR as described in <a href="#checking-the-rrsig-rr-validity">Checking the RRSIG RR Validity</a> and reconstructed the original signed data as described in <a href="#reconstructing-the-signed-data">Reconstructing the Signed Data</a>, the validator can attempt to use the cryptographic signature to authenticate the signed data, and thus (finally!) authenticate the RRset.</p>
<p>The Algorithm field in the RRSIG RR identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to generate the signature. The signature itself is contained in the Signature field of the RRSIG RDATA, and the public key used to verify the signature is contained in the Public Key field of the matching DNSKEY RR(s). [x.x.x] provides a list of algorithm types and provides pointers to the documents that define each algorithm’s use.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for more than one DNSKEY RR to match the conditions in <a href="#checking-the-rrsig-rr-validity">Checking the RRSIG RR Validity</a>. In this case, the validator can only determine which DNSKEY RR is correct by trying each matching public key until the validator either succeeds in validating the signature or runs out of keys to try.</p>
<p>If the Labels field of the RRSIG RR is not equal to the number of labels in the RRset’s fully qualified owner name, then the RRset is either invalid or the result of wildcard expansion. The resolver MUST verify that wildcard expansion was applied properly before considering the RRset to be authentic. [x.x.x] describes how to determine whether a wildcard was applied properly.</p>
<p>If other RRSIG RRs also cover this RRset, the local resolver security policy determines whether the resolver also has to test these RRSIG RRs and how to resolve conflicts if these RRSIG RRs lead to differing results.</p>
<p>If the resolver accepts the RRset as authentic, the validator MUST set the TTL of the RRSIG RR and each RR in the authenticated RRset to a value no greater than the minimum of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the RRset’s TTL as received in the response;</p></li>
<li><p>the RRSIG RR’s TTL as received in the response;</p></li>
<li><p>the value in the RRSIG RR’s Original TTL field; and</p></li>
<li><p>the difference of the RRSIG RR’s Signature Expiration time and the current time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the number of labels in an RRset’s owner name is greater than the Labels field of the covering RRSIG RR, then the RRset and its covering RRSIG RR were created as a result of wildcard expansion. Once the validator has verified the signature, as described in [x.x.x], it must take additional steps to verify the non- existence of an exact match or closer wildcard match for the query. <a href="#authenticated-denial-of-existance">Authenticated Denial of Existance</a> discusses these steps.</p>
<p>Note that the response received by the resolver should include all NSEC RRs needed to authenticate the response (see [x.x.x]).</p>
<h3 data-number="10.7.4" id="authenticated-denial-of-existance"><span class="header-section-number">10.7.4</span> Authenticated Denial of Existance</h3>
<p>A resolver can use authenticated NSEC RRs to prove that an RRset is not present in a signed zone. Security-aware name servers should automatically include any necessary NSEC RRs for signed zones in their responses to security-aware resolvers.</p>
<p>Denial of existence is determined by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the requested RR name matches the owner name of an authenticated NSEC RR, then the NSEC RR’s type bit map field lists all RR types present at that owner name, and a resolver can prove that the requested RR type does not exist by checking for the RR type in the bit map. If the number of labels in an authenticated NSEC RR’s owner name equals the Labels field of the covering RRSIG RR, then the existence of the NSEC RR proves that wildcard expansion could not have been used to match the request.</p></li>
<li><p>If the requested RR name would appear after an authenticated NSEC RR’s owner name and before the name listed in that NSEC RR’s Next Domain Name field according to the canonical DNS name order defined in [RFC 4034], then no RRsets with the requested name exist in the zone. However, it is possible that a wildcard could be used to match the requested RR owner name and type, so proving that the requested RRset does not exist also requires proving that no possible wildcard RRset exists that could have been used to generate a positive response.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, security-aware resolvers MUST authenticate the NSEC RRsets that comprise the non-existence proof as described in [x.x.x].</p>
<p>To prove the non-existence of an RRset, the resolver must be able to verify both that the queried RRset does not exist and that no relevant wildcard RRset exists. Proving this may require more than</p>
<p>one NSEC RRset from the zone. If the complete set of necessary NSEC RRsets is not present in a response (perhaps due to message truncation), then a security-aware resolver MUST resend the query in order to attempt to obtain the full collection of NSEC RRs necessary to verify the non-existence of the requested RRset. As with all DNS operations, however, the resolver MUST bound the work it puts into answering any particular query.</p>
<p>Since a validated NSEC RR proves the existence of both itself and its corresponding RRSIG RR, a validator MUST ignore the settings of the NSEC and RRSIG bits in an NSEC RR.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason none of the RRSIGs can be validated, the response SHOULD be considered BAD. If the validation was being done to service a recursive query, the name server MUST return RCODE 2 to the originating client. However, it MUST return the full response if and only if the original query had the CD bit set. Also see [x.x.x] on caching responses that do not validate.</p>
